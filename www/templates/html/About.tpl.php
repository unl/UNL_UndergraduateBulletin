    <h3 class="sec_header">GENERAL NAVIGATION</h3>
    <p>The <em>Undergraduate Bulletin</em> tab on the main NAVIGATION BAR at the top of the page is the bulletin's main or first page.&nbsp; The user should click on this tab whenever they want to return to the bulletin's main page.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The user can also choose to go to a COLLEGE page, a MAJOR page, the university's ACADEMIC POLICIES page or learn about COURSES from either the NAVIGATION BAR at the top of the page or by selecting the same items from options provided on the main page.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>One of the benefits to the bulletin is that each page is similar in the way the content is presented. Some colleges and majors have slightly different menu items and may have chosen to populate their pages in a slightly different way, but overall, the user should find the navigation easy to understand and fairly standard.</p>
    <h3 class="sec_header">GENERAL CONTENT GUIDELINES</h3>
    <p>The intent of the bulletin document is to include academic curriculum, policies and procedures that guide students in their quest to earn a degree. In developing the bulletin, the colleges were asked to include only information that is academic in scope.&nbsp; Information that has historically been a part of the bulletin that is not defined as curriculum, as an academic policy or as an academic procedure, and that is described on the UNL greater website, has not been included in the 2010-2011 bulletin.&nbsp; </p>
    <h3 class="sec_header">CONTENT UPDATES and ARCHIVING: </h3>
    <p>Please recognize that the bulletin content will change during the summer months of 2010 as colleges review their COLLEGE and MAJOR pages and submit corrections and additions. The bulletin file should &quot;freeze&quot; sometime in August, 2010 (date TBA). The &quot;frozen&quot; version will be the one that is archived as the year passes and the next bulletin is brought forward.</p>
    <h3 class="sec_header">COURSE DESCRIPTIONS (CONTENT)</h3>
    <p>The course descriptions in the bulletin feed from the UNL CREQ database. The feed will &quot;lock&quot; when the bulletin &quot;freezes&quot; so any course updates that occur in CREQ after the bulletin freeze date will NOT display in the bulletin. In this way we will have a historical record of what was in place during the bulletin year in question.</p>
    <h3 class="sec_header">FINDING A MAJOR OR DEGREE</h3>
    <p>The bulletin offers several ways for the user to search for a degree, major or program of study.&nbsp; The bulletin uses the term "MAJOR" interchangeably for these terms.&nbsp; There are several ways to search for a major:&nbsp; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>&nbsp;Users who know any portion of the major name can use the &nbsp;FIND A MAJOR OR DEGREE search box to find a specific major:
            <ul>
                <li>Type any part of the major name in the search box and click the blue SEARCH button.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>A, Ac, Acc, Account, Accounting ("A" returns all majors beginning with the letter "A", "Ac" returns all majors beginning with the letters "Ac" etc.)</li>
                    <li>Tourism (returns two Hospitality, Restaurant and Tourism majors offered by CASNR and EHS)</li>
                </ul>
                <li>User is taken directly to the MAJOR page of the major selected. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Users who want to search all majors offered by a specific college may use the <em>COLLEGE LIST</em> ON &nbsp;THE FIRST PAGE OF THE BULLETIN:
            <ul>
                <li>Click on the desired college under the <em>College Information</em> header provided on the first page of the bulletin.</li>
                <li>Example:&nbsp; College of Business Administration</li>
                <li>The user is taken to the College of Business Administration's COLLEGE page. 
                    <p>A list of majors offered by the College of Business Administration are on the right side of this page. &nbsp;See note below about major searches in this section (*). &nbsp;</p>
                </li>
                <li>Click on the desired major. The user is taken directly to the MAJOR page of the major selected. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Users who want to search all majors offered by a specific college can use the NAVIGATION BAR AT THE TOP OF ANY PAGE OF THE BULLETIN:
            <ul>
                <li>Click on "Academic Colleges" on the navigation bar provided at the top of any bulletin page. </li>
                <li>Example:&nbsp; College of Arts and Sciences</li>
                <li>The user is taken to the College of Arts and Sciences" COLLEGE page.&nbsp; The user will find a list of all majors offered by the College of Arts and Sciences.&nbsp; See note below about major searches in this section (*).&nbsp; </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Users who want to find a listing of all UNL majors can use the FIND A MAJOR OR DEGREE SEARCH BOX-NO CRITERIA OPTION:
            <ul>
                <li>Insert cursor in the FIND A MAJOR OR DEGREE SEARCH field on the front page of the bulletin.&nbsp; <strong>Do not put any criteria in this field</strong>. Click the blue SEARCH button. </li>
                <li>All UNL majors are listed. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Users who want a listing of all majors can use the NAVIGATION BAR:
            <ul>
                <li>Click on "Majors" on the navigation bar provided at the top of any bulletin page.</li>
                <li>Select "Search for a Major".&nbsp; All UNL majors are listed. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>(*)Note about Major Lists on SEARCH Results:&nbsp; </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Majors that are offered in more than one college are noted with the college designation on any major list.&nbsp; For example, both CASNR and ASC offer a major in Plant Biology. Thus Plant Biology appears twice on the major list. </li>
        <li>The default for listing majors as a result of a search is to include all majors and minors. The minors that are listed on a search result atr minors for which the department does not have a corresponding major.&nbsp; Departments included these minors if the minor is open to all students.&nbsp; For example, ASC offers a Japanese major but not a minor.&nbsp; In a search to find all majors, the Japanese minor would be listed as Japanese (Minor) and the list that the search returns.&nbsp; Majors that offer both a major and a minor are only listed once on a search result.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The minors are included on the search result because the default filter option is checked to include all minors.&nbsp; Users who do not want to include minors in their search can de-select "Minor Available-All".&nbsp; To make changes in the filter options before searching, use the NAVIGATION BAR method for searching majors. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="sec_header">FINDING A MINOR</h3>
    <p>One feature that the new bulletin provides is the opportunity for the user to search for minors. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>To see a listing of all minors use the NAVIGATION BAR AT THE TOP OF ANY PAGE OF THE BULLETIN
            <ul>
                <li>Click on "Academic Colleges" on the navigation bar provided at the top of any bulletin page. </li>
                <li>Note this page presents a FILTER which allows the user to select majors by college as well as minors.&nbsp; The default is checked to include all colleges and all minors. This is why all majors and minors are included in the major listing searched via this method. </li>
                <li>The "Minor" designation is included when the minor does not have a corresponding major.&nbsp; For example, the Japanese minor in ASC does not have a corresponding Japanese major.&nbsp; Thus this program is listed as Japanese (Minor).&nbsp; When the user clicks on this kind of minor, the user is taken to the actual minor page (i.e. the Japanese Minor page).&nbsp; </li>
                <li>Many departments offer both a major and a minor. In this case only the major is listed on a search result.&nbsp; For example, the Marketing department offers both a major and a minor.&nbsp; When Marketing is selected, the user is taken to the Marketing MAJOR page.&nbsp; To view the requirements for the Marketing Minor, the user may select the MINOR item that it is on the CONTENTS pull-down menu on the Marketing Major page.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="sec_header">COURSES</h3>
    <p>The user may locate course information via several options.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>FIND A COURSE search box:</li>
        <li>Users who know the <em>4-digit subject code</em> of a specific course may use this option to find a specific course.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example entering ECON will return all courses with the ECON subject code.&nbsp; Users unfamiliar with the <em>4-digit subject code system can</em> can select "Courses-Course Abbreviations" on the NAVIGATION BAR AT THE TOP OF ANY PAGE OF THE BULLETIN
            <ul>
                <li>When the user selects a course (ECON 211), they are taken to the course description page.&nbsp; This page displays information associated with the course:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Descriptions: Course description</li>
                        <li>Prerequisite:&nbsp; Prerequisites are the courses and requirements the department has identified that the student should demonstrate to find success in the course.&nbsp; Students should interpret prerequisites as requirements they must meet to stay enrolled in the course</li>
                        <li>ACE Outcomes:&nbsp; The ACE Outcome the course fulfills is noted here if the course is a certified course for ACE Outcome(s). <em>See the FILTER on this page to learn all options for the search selected. &nbsp;</em></li>
                        <li>Credit Hours:&nbsp; The number of credit hours of the course is listed.</li>
                        <li>Course Format:&nbsp; This field lists the course's component type (Lecture, Lab etc.). <em>See the FILTER on this page to learn all options for the search selected.</em>&nbsp; </li>
                        <li>Course Delivery:&nbsp; The typical way the course is delivered is listed (Classroom, Internet etc.). </li>
                        <li>Groups:&nbsp; Some departments list their courses by sub-category.&nbsp; For instance, ECON 211 has been identified by the Economics department as being a "General Economics and Theory" course.&nbsp; This is important to note because some majors require students to meet specific group requirements.&nbsp; </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The user may also use the FIND A COURSE search box to search for courses that meet specific requirements:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The user can search for ACE courses:<br />
                            <strong>ACE: 1</strong> retrieves all courses that meet the ACE 1 Outcome</li>
                        <li><em>There is also discussion of adding an option to search for all Honors courses. More about this later.</em></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

                        <li>The user is taken to a page which allows the user to FILTER by Course Format and ACE Outcome. </li>
                        <li>Select any course format criteria or ACE Outcome criteria to filter the course listing desired. </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>COURSE DESCRIPTION within the MAJOR PAGE context:
            <ul>
                <li>Users can view course descriptions for any course that is specifically identified within the body of the text of the MAJOR PAGE.&nbsp; </li>
                <li>Roll over the course and the course description displays. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>COURSE TAB on the MAJOR PAGE:
            <ul>
                <li>This tab displays courses that the department has identified as likely courses the user reviewing the major may be interested in learning about.&nbsp; On the tab Departments have included courses from <em>4-digit subject areas</em> that are most associated with the major. Students should work their adviser to identify appropriate course choices. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="sec_header">COLLEGE PAGE</h3>
    <p>Each of UNL's undergraduate colleges and the College of Public Affairs and Community Service has their own COLLEGE page.&nbsp; This page includes all of the college's academic policies and procedures such as college admission requirements, college rules about the pass/no pass grade option and residency etc.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Colleges have their own educational philosophies.&nbsp; In developing the bulletin, colleges have the latitude to develop their college information within the framework of the bulletin template.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, one college may choose to include curriculum within their COLLEGE page whereas another college may choose to include all curriculum requirements on theits MAJOR pages.&nbsp; The user may access COLLEGE pages one of two ways:</p>
