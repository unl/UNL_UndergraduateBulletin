				<p class="basic-text">Consistent with the mission and values of the University, Achievement-Centered Education (ACE) is based on a shared set of four institutional objectives and 10 student learning outcomes. The ACE program was approved by faculty in all eight undergraduate colleges and endorsed by the Faculty Senate, the student government, and the Academic Planning Committee in January 2008 and implemented in the fall 2009. ACE aligns with current national initiatives in general education.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Key characteristics of ACE demonstrate the benefits of the program to students:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">Students receive a broad education with exposure to multiple disciplines, critical life skills and important reasoning, inquiry, and civic capacities.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">ACE is simple and transparent for students, faculty and advisers. Students complete the equivalent of 3 credit hours for each of the ten student learning outcomes.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Students connect and integrate their ACE experiences with their selected major.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Students can transfer all ACE certified courses across colleges within the institution to meet the ACE requirement and any course from outside the institution that is directly equivalent to a UNL ACE-certified course. Courses from outside institutions without direct equivalents may be considered with appropriate documentation for ACE credit (see academic adviser).</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">ACE allows faculty to assess and improve their effectiveness and facilitate students’ learning.</li>

				<p class="basic-text">The University Honors Program is a special program for which formal application is required. Students admitted to the Program have ACT composite scores in the upper 20s or above, are in the top ten percent of their high school class and, most importantly, have demonstrated a commitment to intellectual curiosity and academic excellence. Acceptance into the Program is based on a comprehensive evaluation of the student’s potential by the Honors Program Faculty Committee. All the undergraduate colleges support the Program, and honors courses apply to college and major requirements. A special notation is made on the transcript and diploma upon graduation from the University Honors Program to inform graduate schools and employers of the student’s superior performance. Honors Program students may request housing in the honors residence, the Neihardt Residence Center.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students admitted to the University Honors Program have access to all honors courses taught at UNL without additional authorization.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">NOTE:</span> 189H Freshman Seminar is an honors course offered by participating academic departments. Required of all students in the University Honors Program.</p>
