				<p class="basic-text">The field experience component of the MCRP program provides an excellent means for students to augment and expand their planning skills, to more closely examine their career aspirations, and to evaluate their academic progress. Internships provide students with unique learning experiences that are impossible to replicate in the classroom. Many internships provide financial assistance for students while they are in school and often facilitate their search for employment after graduation. The internship component of the MCRP program also is an important vehicle for fulfilling the public service mission of the community and regional planning program, the College of Architecture, and the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.</p>
				<p class="content-box-m-p">ACE REQUIREMENTS</p>
				<p class="title-2">Achievement-Centered Education (ACE)</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The University of Nebraska–Lincoln requires all students receive a broad general education as part of their academic experience. This requirement translates into the obligation of all students to fulfill the requirements of the ACE program. Information about the ACE program may be viewed at ace.unl.edu.</p>
				<p class="title-3">English</p>
				<p class="basic-text">It is of vital importance that architects, landscape architects, and interior designers be able to express themselves clearly and concisely. As a matter of routine, architects and interior designers are called upon to prepare reports, papers, or specifications in which clarity and precision are essential. For this reason, a student is required to do more than meet the English composition course requirement. In daily oral and written work the student must demonstrate an acceptable skill in the use of effective English. The dean may require students who fail to meet acceptable standards to do additional work in English composition or speech communication. Each instructor is expected to bring to the dean’s attention the students who need additional work.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students are expected to take ENGL 101 plus ENGL 151. Or they may take ENGL 150 plus ENGL 151. ENGL 186, 187 and 192 may not be used to satisfy the freshman English composition requirement.</p>
				<p class="title-3">Mathematics</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students in the architecture program are required to receive credit for MATH 106. Courses taken as deficiencies to qualify for MATH 106 will not apply as credit toward their degree. Students in landscape architecture are required to take either MATH 106 or STAT 218 to fulfill their mathematics requirement. Students in the interior design program are required to take either MATH 203 or STAT 218 to fulfill their mathematics requirement.</p>
				<p class="content-box-m-p">BULLETIN RULE </p>
				<p class="title-2">Degree Time Limits</p>

				<p class="title-1">Grading Appeals</p>
				<p class="basic-text">A student wishing to appeal a grade should contact his or her professor for clarification first before an appeal can be filed. If the dispute cannot be resolved with the instructor it is recommended that the student meet with their adviser to get clarification on the appeals process. Appeals are only considered where it can be demonstrated that prejudice or capricious treatment influenced the grade received by the student.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Having exhausted these avenues, a student may then choose to make a formal appeal. The appeal is in the form of a written statement from the student to the program chair. The chair will then forward the letter to the Faculty Affairs Committee. The deadline for filing a grade appeal (which includes a written statement from the student) is 30 calendar days after the first day of classes of the next regular semester (fall or spring). Appeals filed after the deadline will not be heard.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Incomplete Grades</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Incompletes for students in the pre-professional program shall be granted only for reasons outlined in the policy statement adopted by the University Senate. See the UNL <span class="basic-text-ital">Schedule of Classes</span> for the complete text.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Incompletes given to students in the professional program are granted at the discretion of the faculty awarding the grade. The faculty and student together must file an incomplete form in the department office to register the anticipated completion date and the grade that will be registered if the work is not completed by that time.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Architecture students will be allowed a maximum of two weeks to remove incompletes from courses that are prerequisites to classes in which they are currently enrolled or they will be administratively dropped from those courses.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Scholastic Standing </p>
				<p class="basic-text">The following scholastic standards have been established to maintain the level of quality for students enrolled in the architecture program: </p>
				<p class="title-3">Pre-Professional Program, Architecture, Landscape Architecture and Interior Design</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students in the first year are required to maintain both a semester and cumulative grade point average at or above 2.0. The standard rises to a grade point average of 2.6 in the second year. Admission into the third year of all programs requires a cumulative grade point average of 2.6. The College places students who fail to meet these standards on academic probation.</p>
				<p class="title-3">Third and Fourth Year, Architecture</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students in the third and fourth year of the BSD program are required to meet two parallel academic standards. First the student must maintain a semester grade point average of 2.6 to remain in good academic standing. The program places students who fail to meet this standard on academic probation. Further, students whose GPA for the academic year is between 2.6 and 3.0 are required to submit their studio work for review by the Student Affairs Committee for determination of continuance in the program or repetition of the year’s studio sequence.</p>
				<p class="title-3">Third and Fourth Year, Interior Design and Landscape Architecture</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students in the third and fourth year of the BSD program are required to maintain a 2.6 cumulative grade point average to remain in good academic standing. The program also requires that students earn a grade of a C or higher in all required courses. The program places students who fail to meet this standard on academic probation.</p>
				<p class="title-3">Fifth and Sixth Year, Architecture</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students in the MArch program are required to maintain a semester grade point average of 3.0 to remain in good academic standing. The program places students who fail to meet this standard on academic probation.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Minimum Grades</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students must earn at least a C (2.0) in all courses with an ARCH, IDES, or LARC prefix to earn credit toward their degree. Students will be required to retake all core required courses with a grade of C- or below, but will not be required to repeat courses that were taken as electives.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Removal of Grades C- or Below</p>
				<p class="basic-text">A professional student receiving a grade of C- or below for an overall course grade may remove that grade by retaking the same course again and receiving a higher grade. The higher grade will be used to compute the student’s cumulative grade point average, but all grades appear on the student’s transcript. The Pass/No Pass option cannot be used to remove these grades from the grade point average. Please be advised that once a course is no longer taught and no longer offered by the department it is not possible to remove a grade of C- or below through substitution or any other means.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Should you perform poorly in many courses during a semester it is possible to bankrupt the entire semester’s grades. This is a drastic action and should be pursued only after a visit with your adviser.</p>
				<p class="title-3">Pass/No Pass Limits </p>
				<p class="basic-text">None of the required classes offered in the professional program are offered Pass/No Pass, but a maximum of 12 Pass/No Pass credit hours of humanities, social sciences, or open electives may be taken from departments outside the College of Architecture.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Courses taken outside the architecture, landscape architecture, or interior design programs to fulfill the upper level outside elective requirement at the 800 level or 900 level, with or without a 400-level counterpart, in a minor, collateral, or supporting area of work, can be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Transfer Credit Rules</p>
				<p class="basic-text">All professional credit earned at another university to be applied toward the master of architecture degree must be approved by the Professional Program Committee in cooperation with the program director. At least 50 percent of the required course work for the professional degree must be completed at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln with the exception of those students who are applying to enter the program with a four year degree from an accredited architecture program. No professional transfer credit will be accepted from a non-accredited architecture program.</p>
				<p class="title-2">College Evaluation of Transfer Credit</p>
				<p class="basic-text">First time students transferring to the College of Architecture from a similar accredited professional degree program will be evaluated on the basis of the current undergraduate bulletin in effect at the time the student enrolls in the College of Architecture.</p>
				<p class="title-3">Process</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The program director will select and identify those courses that are applicable to the professional program in architecture, interior design, and landscape architecture programs. The College of Architecture will not accept courses for transfer which are below a 2.0 on a 4-point scale.</p>
				<p class="title-3">Evaluation of Technical and Nonaccredited Transfer Credits</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students who desire to transfer credits from technical or nonaccredited colleges must have architecture credits evaluated by the director and/or appropriate program representatives. Non-architecture credits will be evaluated by the appropriate university department.</p>
				<p class="title-3">Evaluation of Graphics, Design, and Production Drawing Credit</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Transfer credit for graphics, basic and architectural, landscape architecture, and/or interior design work and production drawings will not be granted until the student’s work has been reviewed by the architecture, landscape architecture, or interior design program director. Allowable transfer credit in the design, production drawings, and graphics areas, whether the grades presented are C, B, or A, will be determined from this review and the student placed accordingly.</p>
				<p class="title-3">Confirmation procedure:</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">1. It is the student’s responsibility to initiate this task,</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">2. The student procedure is to obtain the confirmation form from the program office and to seek review of appropriate materials, and</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">3. A “portfolio review” will determine confirmation of credit. This review will be done by the appropriate faculty member or committee.</p>
				<p class="title-3">Evaluation of General Education Credits</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Transfer students who have formally applied for admission will have their academic credits evaluated by the University Office of Registration and Records and the College of Architecture. The College will evaluate all hours submitted on an admission application but reserves the right to reject any of these credits.</p>
				<p class="title-3">Clarification and Appeal</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The student who has questions about or wishes to appeal the initial College evaluation of his or her transfer credit should contact the program office. If the evaluation is not satisfactorily resolved, the student has the right to register an appeal with the Student Affairs Committee of the architecture, landscape architecture, or interior design programs.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Independent Study</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Credit hours earned through independent study (ARCH 398, 498, 598 and 898; LARC 398, 498, 598; and IDES 398, 498, 898) need to be formally arranged with the faculty member supervising the work prior to registration for those credit hours. This is accomplished through completion of the Independent Study Contract available in the program office. It must have the signature of the faculty sponsor and be filed with the program office in order to be valid.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students are limited to a total of <span class="basic-text-bold">9 credit hours </span>of independent study over the course of their academic career in the professional program.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Other College Degree Requirements</p>
				<p class="title-2">Off-Campus Programs</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The College of Architecture recognizes the need for some students to pursue their pre-architecture, pre-landscape architecture, and pre-interior design studies at other institutions. Up to two semesters (30 semester credit hours) of off-campus study should cause minimal delay in students’ educational timetables if courses can be selected from the following list and are approved by the College of Architecture. Students are encouraged to coordinate their off-campus pre-architecture, pre-landscape architecture, and pre-interior design programs with the College of Architecture.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Recommended Courses</p>

				<p class="basic-text">The community and regional planning program offers the master of community and regional planning (MCRP) degree; however, several courses in the Department are also offered at the advanced undergraduate level and are available to undergraduate students in all majors.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The master of community and regional planning degree program provides preparation for professional planning practice in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Planning is an interdisciplinary problem-solving profession that influences a broad range of future-oriented decision making. Planners work with individuals, groups, and organizations to formulate plans, policies, and strategies through which desired change can be achieved. Planners utilize a wide variety of methods and techniques to identify problems and needs and to formulate plans of action that effectively address those needs. Planners often need to accommodate differing viewpoints in the process of formulating desirable and compatible plan and policy recommendations.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The MCRP degree program emphasizes the understanding of the importance of and interrelationships among human resources, natural resources, socio-cultural characteristics, economic activity, political and institutional roles, and characteristics of the natural and built environment. The program provides students with a sound foundation in planning theory, methods, process, and application–a background which enables graduates to formulate, initiate, and coordinate a broad range of planning and development actions.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Master of Community and Regional Planning Curriculum</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The MCRP degree program requires completion of 48 graduate credit hours, 24 of which are in a required core curriculum.</p>
