				<p class="content-box-h-1">DESCRIPTION</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students in international business study the business practices of other nations and learn how international trade laws affect the world economy. A background in international business will help students become a better member of the management team of any corporation. From banks to manufacturing firms, an increasing number of industries need professionals who understand the world’s business environment. Import and export firms, agricultural commodities firms, and government and non-government agencies may specifically seek international expertise. Students are encouraged to consult with advisers in the Dean’s Office for Undergraduate Programs for the selection of appropriate courses to meet the requirements for the major.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students are encouraged to begin thinking about their plans to study abroad during their freshman year by visiting with the advising office staff, and representatives of International Affairs, 420 University Terrace. It is suggested that students begin language and culture courses their freshman year as well. Upper-level course work and study abroad experience should be done sometime in the junior or senior year. The Advising Office will work with students to outline how their study abroad courses will fulfill program requirements.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Because the nature of the major requires careful selection of course work to count for appropriate requirements, students are strongly encouraged to consult with their adviser or a staff member in the Dean’s Office for Undergraduate Programs. For specific prerequisite requirements and concurrent registration options, refer to the individual course descriptions.</p>

				<p class="title-1">International Business Minor</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">The international business minor is available to College of Business Administration students only. The college expects that 50% of the course work for the minor will be completed at UNL.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Course work used for this minor cannot be double counted toward business core foundation (BCF) intermediate (BCI) or advanced-major (BCA-M, BCA-A) degree requirements, for another major, nor any other business minor requirements.</li>

					<li class="bullet-2">Do NOT confuse this ruling with permission to double count major/minor course work; this applies only to the 12 hours of 300/400-level elective course work requirement.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Students must complete 60 hours of business course work throughout their program. International business majors are permitted to count the 6 hours of language required for the major as part of their 60 hour requirement of business course work. </li>
					<li class="bullet-2">MOST majors are required to take one additional business course throughout their entire program to fulfill their business elective requirement. International business majors selecting non-business course work as part of their major (maximum of 6 hours) will need to take additional business electives (3-6 hours depending on how many hours they selected) to fulfill the 60 hour business course work requirement.</li>
