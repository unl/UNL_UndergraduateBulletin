				<p class="basic-text">The career path for Family Science (working with children and families) provides a comprehensive program grounded in family science theory, research, and professional practice and application. The distinct feature of this career path is that it provides students with knowledge and intervention skills that will assist them in helping to prevent and remedy interpersonal problems experienced by individuals in their family relationships, building on the family’s strengths. In addition, this career path will prepare students for graduate school (e.g. family science, family therapy, social work, counseling psychology, and law), or for employment in human services agencies or programs. Students are prepared to work in human service agencies or nonprofit agencies serving individuals and families. Students selecting several courses in the economic and family finance content area are prepared to advise in the areas of consumer credit and financial management. These courses may make them eligible to take the Accredited Financial Counselors examinations.</p>
