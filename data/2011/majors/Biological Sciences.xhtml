				<p class="basic-text">The School of Biological Sciences offers educational opportunities in various areas of biology leading toward either the bachelor of arts or the bachelor of science degree. Study in the biological sciences prepares students for a variety of careers requiring knowledge of biological processes, such as teaching; environmental resource management and assessment; production and sales of biological materials; research in governmental, industrial, and academic laboratories; as well as preparation for careers in medicine, dentistry, and health-related professions.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Work.</span> The advanced degrees of master of science, and doctor of philosophy are offered. For details, see the Graduate Studies Bulletin.</p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>

				<p class="basic-text">The following courses will NOT count toward the biological sciences major: BIOS 140, BIOS 150, BIOS 160, BIOS 203, BIOS 220, BIOS 222, BIOS 232 or BIOS 280. BIOS 395 Internship is offered Pass/No Pass only and therefore may not be used in the major.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">No minor is required, but biological sciences majors must complete the following ancillary courses in addition to the 36 hours in the major:</p>
				<p class="list-indent">BIOC 321 <span class="faculty-list-bold">or</span> BIOC 431</p>

				<p class="basic-text">Additionally, biological sciences majors are strongly urged to attend the Cedar Point Biological Station for at least one summer session. Majors are also encouraged to do a research project with a faculty member.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Program Assessment.</span> To assist the department in evaluating the effectiveness of its program, after significantly completing the course work, all majors will be required in their senior year to register for BIOS 99 and complete selected assessment activities.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Results of participation in these assessment activities will in no way affect a student’s GPA or graduation.</p>
