				<p class="basic-text">A minor in Asian studies complements a liberal arts education by providing knowledge about the cultures and other aspects of a major part of the world. A minor also provides the basic background for additional studies of Asia in graduate school. Courses that may apply to the minor are offered by a variety of departments (see the following list), but several classes are not scheduled each semester.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Foreign Study.</span> The University of Nebraska–Lincoln cooperates with Nanzan University in Nagoya, Japan, in sponsoring an academic exchange program that allows UNL students to pay University of Nebraska tuition, fees, and housing costs here and then earn resident credit while studying for a year in Japan. In China, UNL has exchange programs with Peking University, China’s premier university and located in the national capital; XI’an Jiaotong University, a leading school in northwestern China; and Chinese University of Hong Kong. Interested students should contact the chair for the Asian Studies Committee for more information and application procedures.</p>
