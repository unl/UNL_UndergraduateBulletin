Students must file a College-Degree-Major-Adviser (CDMA) Change Form with the College Student Services Center, 105 Henzlik, prior to filing for graduation.</p>

				<p class="basic-text">There are a wide variety of minors offered outside of the College of Education and Human Sciences. An undergraduate student with a major in human sciences who wants a minor in another college should consult with their College of Education and Human Sciences adviser and prepare the list of approved courses desired for the minor. There may be a Plan A or Plan B option for some minors. Plan A indicates a single minor; Plan B indicates two minors with fewer hours in each subject than the number required for a single minor.</p>
