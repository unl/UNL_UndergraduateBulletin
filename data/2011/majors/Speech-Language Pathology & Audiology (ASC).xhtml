				<p class="basic-text">The program in Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology is housed in the Department of Special Education and Communication Disorders in the College of Education and Human Sciences. The program offers both a bachelor of arts degree and a bachelor of science degree through the College of Arts and Sciences and a bachelor of science degree through the College of Education and Human Sciences. Both degrees provide the preprofessional courses required for graduate study in either speech-language pathology or audiology. The entry level for practice as a speech-language pathologist requires a masters degree. A doctorate of audiology (AuD) is required to practice audiology. For information on programs leading to degrees and for a detailed description of courses required, please see the College of Education and Human Sciences section of this bulletin.</p>
