				<p class="basic-text">The Department of Modern Languages and Literatures offers courses in German, Japanese, the Romance Language group (French, Spanish), and the Slavic group (Czech, Russian). Whenever possible, the courses are conducted in the language that is studied. The aim of instruction is reading, writing, aural and oral proficiency, and an understanding of the life, literature, and culture of the country. Lectures and films in the language studied are offered during the school year for the benefit of the students in the department. Language laboratories supplement class work.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Placement</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Incoming students who wish to enter the University’s language program in French, Spanish, and German are required to take the Computer Assisted Placement Examination (CAPE). The results of the placement exam, together with training in a secondary school university, or other prior second language environments, will assist students in finding the level at which they will have the greatest opportunity for success. The examination results will be used in combination with advising to determine appropriate placement in the sequence of courses offered within the department’s curriculum. CAPE is administered in the language laboratory (302 Burnett Hall). Those students exempted from this requirement are expected to enroll in a first semester elementary course (101). Students qualifying for this exemption are defined as follows:</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">1. Students with no previous second language exposure whatsoever.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">2. Students whose second language exposure amounts to one year or less at the U.S. high school level.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">3. Students who wish to begin study of a new language other than those previously studied.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph">For other languages, placement is generally determined by the following criteria for students who come to the University with:</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">1. 1 semester of a language in high school should take 101 (same language or a new one);</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">2. 2 or 3 semesters in high school should take 102 (same language);</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">3. 4 or 5 semesters in high school should take 201;</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">4. 6 semesters in high school should take 202;</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">5. 8 semesters or more in high school should take 203.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The department participates in the following interdisciplinary study programs: European Studies, Institute for Ethnic Studies, International Studies, Judaic Studies, Latin American Studies, Medieval and Renaissance Studies, and Women’s and Gender Studies. See the index for a guide to these programs.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students may receive full credit at the University of Nebraska for study abroad programs in many countries, among these are Costa Rica, France, Germany, Spain, Mexico, Russia, Japan, and the Czech Republic. See the index for a guide to these programs.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Auditing.</span> Audits are allowed in 101 in French, German and Spanish only upon recommendation of the Modern Language Placement Advisers. Otherwise no audits are allowed in 100- and 200-level classes.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Literature in Translation</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The Department offers the following literature in translation courses for which no knowledge of a foreign language is necessary.
