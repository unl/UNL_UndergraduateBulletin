				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The advertising and public relations major prepares students for careers in a wide variety of communication-related areas. Recent graduates have been placed in more than 20 states and several other countries in diverse advertising careers such as retail and corporate advertising and marketing, media sales, brand management, media planning, account management, research, public relations, media relations, special event planning, Internet communications, copywriting and layout and design.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The advertising faculty believes that a successful career must be built upon a solid foundation, an education that combines theory and practice. To achieve that end, the major offers courses in copywriting, layout, media planning, graphics, campaign development, research, management, and strategic communications. The curriculum is designed to emphasize strategy, planning and implementation in creative problem solving.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Much emphasis is placed on individual relationships between faculty and students, an interaction vital to a student’s creative development. A faculty adviser also helps each student tailor an academic plan to meet his or her interests and needs.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">In advertising and strategic communications classes, students often work with actual clients who present real-life problems. This experience gives students a professional perspective on problem solving in many sectors including nonprofit, retail, small business and community organizations as well as large corporations. Students are encouraged to augment their academic experience with internships.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The faculty, with many professional contacts both locally and nationwide, actively help place students in jobs within the state and throughout the country. Students interested in majoring in advertising and public relations should contact the college office in 147 Andersen Hall.</span></p>
