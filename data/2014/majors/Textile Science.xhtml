<p>ACE Requirements</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">All UNL students will be required to complete a minimum of 3 hours of approved course work in each of the 10 designated Achievement Centered Education (ACE) student learning outcome areas. These can be viewed at http://ace.unl.edu. Students will be provided a list of classes they can select from to meet each of the 10 ACE Student Learning Outcomes (SLO). There may be required courses within an education endorsement program that will also satisfy ACE requirements. Therefore, it is highly recommended that students contact their adviser prior to registering for ACE classes in order to insure that each of the class selections are in the best interest of the students’ academic program.</p>

<p class="title-1">Minor Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students may receive a minor in Chemistry (27 hrs), Hospitality, Restaurant and Tourism Management (19 hrs) or a Business minor (18 hrs). See adviser. Minors may also be taken in Global Studies or in Women’s and Gender Studies. The student should see their adviser for more information.</p>

<p class="content-box-h-1">ADDITIONAL MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
