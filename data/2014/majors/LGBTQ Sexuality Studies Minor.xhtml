<p class="basic-text">The LGBTQ/Sexuality Studies minor involves the exploration and examination of sexuality and gender through historical, philosophical, literary, anthropological, scientific, sociological, and other lenses. The minor gives students the opportunity to study and critically analyze the experiences of individuals concerning gender and sexuality, as well as to examine gender and sexuality as social constructions that vary throughout history and in different societies. Critical analyses concern how gender and sexuality are formed, defined, regulated, and expressed in biological, social, political, and aesthetic contexts.</p>
