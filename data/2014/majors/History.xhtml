<p class="basic-text">The Department of History offers topical and period courses of general cultural and educational value to all University students to broaden their range of historical experience and sense of perspective. The particular aim of the history program is not only to provide knowledge for students who are preparing for a career in education, but also to give instruction that will aid those with interests in law, journalism, library, and museum work; in local, state, and national public service; and in business where a knowledge of domestic and foreign affairs is particularly useful.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Honors Program.</span> The Department of History offers a four-year program of honors work beginning with honors sections in the introductory courses for freshmen and sophomores. For upperclassmen, the Departmental Honors Program consists of directed reading courses and seminars. In the senior year, an honors student is expected to prepare an honors thesis for a bachelor of arts degree with distinction.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Work. </span>The Department of History offers the advanced degrees of master of arts and doctor of philosophy. For details of these programs, see the <span class="basic-text-ital">Graduate Studies Bulletin</span>.</p>
