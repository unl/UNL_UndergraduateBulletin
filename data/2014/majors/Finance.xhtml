<p class="basic-text">The goal of any financial system is to allocate monetary resources to those individuals, companies and governmental units that have the best ideas for usage. The study of finance focuses on the organization and development of capital markets and financial institutions in achieving the optimal usage of funds. As a finance student, you might want to examine how conflict of interest affects managerial performance, how risk influences investment decisions, or how investor psychology can impact the price of stocks and bonds. The finance faculty offer strong support for the exploration of such topics and the curriculum is designed to prepare students in areas of high employment demand.</p>
<p class="basic-text">A solid understanding of the finance role is becoming ever more essential in the management of public, private, and nonprofit organizations. The basic course, FINA 361 (required of all students in the College), presents the institutional background, theory, and decision-making skills essential to an understanding of the corporate finance function. The major theoretical issues and the financial techniques that are used to analyze capital management problems are investigated.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The department also offers a course in personal finance, FINA 260, that exposes students to basic financial concepts such as personal taxes, investment opportunities, insurance issues and retirement planning. The personal finance course is open to all university students and has no prerequisites. Successful completion of FINA 260 satisfies ACE Outcome 6 in the University’s general education requirements.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph">The finance major offers course work in the following areas of specialization:</p>
<p class="list-indent">Banking and Financial Institutions</p>
<p class="list-indent">Risk Management and Insurance</p>
<p class="list-indent">CFA® – Investments</p>
<p class="list-indent">General Finance</p>
<p class="header-paragraph">Finance students must declare one of these specializations as a formal option within their major. Multiple options cannot be chosen.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The finance department faculty hold student advising sessions every semester to discuss course offerings and curriculum requirements. Students are highly encouraged to attend these sessions and to meet with their CBA advisers on a regular basis. The department chair is also available to answer questions regarding the selection of courses or other questions related to the finance curriculum.</p>
