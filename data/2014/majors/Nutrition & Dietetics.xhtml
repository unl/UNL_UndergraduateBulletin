<p class="content-box-h-1">DESCRIPTION</p>
<p class="basic-text">The Nutrition and Dietetics (Didactic Program in Dietetics) option is designed for students who wish to become registered dietitians and practitioners in clinical, community, food industry, and foodservice areas of nutrition and may be employed by hospitals, community agencies, and various government or private organizations. The University of Nebraska–Lincoln Didactic Program in Dietetics is currently granted accreditation status by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2000, Chicago, IL 60606-6995, 312-899-0040, ext. 5400.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The process to become a registered dietitian involves three steps: completion of a bachelors degree with attainment of the Verification Statement of Completion of the Didactic Program in Dietetics; admission into and the completion of an accredited dietetic internship program; and successfully passing the registration exam to earn the Registered Dietitian (RD) credential.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Meeting requirements for the bachelors degree Nutrition and Dietetics option does not automatically result in the student being awarded a Verification Statement of Completion of the Didactic Program in Dietetics. Requirements for attainment of the Verification Statement are listed on the dietetics program website. The Verification Statement of Completion of the Didactic Program in Dietetics is required for admission into an accredited dietetic internship program.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Acceptance into an accredited dietetic internship program is competitive. Currently, there is a significant shortage of available internship positions for the number of students applying for acceptance into an internship program. Acceptance into an internship program cannot be guaranteed.</p>
<p class="basic-text">All required accreditation information and requirements for attainment of the Verification Statement can be found at http://cehs.unl.edu/nhs/undergrad/dietetics.shtml.</p>

<p class="title-1">ACE Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">All UNL students will be required to complete a minimum of 3 hours of approved course work in each of the 10 designated Achievement Centered Education (ACE) student learning outcome areas. These can be viewed at http://ace.unl.edu. Students will be provided a list of classes they can select from to meet each of the 10 ACE Student Learning Outcomes (SLO). There may be required courses within an education endorsement program that will also satisfy ACE requirements. Therefore, it is highly recommended that students contact their adviser prior to registering for ACE classes in order to insure that each of the class selections are in the best interest of the students’ academic program.</p>
<p class="asterisk">* These (*) courses, required in your major, will also meet ACE Requirements.</p>

<p class="content-box-h-1">ADDITIONAL MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p class="title-1">Grade Rules</p>
<p class="title-2">Grades Earned at UNL, UNO, UNK</p>
<p class="basic-text">Grades of D-, D, D+, C- satisfy requirements of the programs in human sciences unless specified otherwise under the Programs and Departments section of the bulletin. Students who receive a grade of D-, D, D+, or C-, however, are encouraged to retake the course, particularly if it is in the major area.</p>
<p class="title-2">Grades Earned Outside UN System</p>
<p class="basic-text">Up to 9 hours of grades below C (C-, D+, D, D-) from other academic institutions can only be applied to general education requirements and elective classes.</p>
<p class="title-2">Policy for Pass/No Pass Courses</p>
<p class="basic-text">The Pass/No Pass (P/N) option is designed for students who want to study elective areas or topics when they may have minimum preparation. If used for this purpose, the option can enrich the student’s academic experience without lowering the student’s grade point average. Free electives may be taken P/N. Students can earn no more than 12 hours of pass credit excluding courses offered on Pass/No Pass only basis. Not all classes can be taken under the Pass/No Pass option. All courses, specified by course and number, must be taken for a grade. Should a student have earned a P in one of the courses prior to starting the option, the P will be reviewed by the appropriate department.</p>            </div>
