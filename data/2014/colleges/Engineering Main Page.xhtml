The College is subdivided into units, each under the leadership of a chairperson, department head, or director.</p>
<p class="content-box-m-p">ADMISSION</p>
<p class="title-1">College Admission</p>
<p class="title-2">College Entrance Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students must have high school credit for (one unit is equal to one high school year):</p>
<p class="list">1. 4 units of mathematics: 2 of algebra, 1 of geometry, 1 of precalculus and trigonometry.</p>
<p class="list">2. 4 units of English.</p>
<p class="list">3. 3 units of natural science that must include 1 unit of physics and 1 unit of chemistry (chemistry requirement waived for students in construction management).</p>
<p class="list">4. 2 units of a single foreign language.</p>
<p class="list">5. 3 units of social studies.</p>
<p class="list">6. Students having a composite ACT score of 28 or greater (or equivalent SAT score) will be admitted to the College of Engineering even if they lack any one of the following: trigonometry, chemistry, or physics.</p>
<p class="list">7. Students having an ACT score of 19 or less in English (or equivalent SAT score) must take ENGL 150 or ENGL 151.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph">A total of 16 units is required for admission.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students must have an ACT (enhanced) score of 24 or greater (or equivalent SAT). Students who lack entrance requirements may be admitted based on ACT scores, high school rank and credits, or may be admitted to pre-engineering status in the Exploratory and Pre-Professional Advising Center. Pre-engineering students are advised within the College of Engineering.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students for whom English is not their language of nurture must meet the minimum English proficiency requirements of the University.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students who lack entrance units may complete precollege training by Independent Study through the UNL Office of On-line and Distance Education, in summer courses, or as a part of their first or second semester course loads while in the Exploratory and Pre-Professional Advising Center or other Colleges at UNL.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students should consult their adviser, their department chair, or the Office of the Dean if they have questions on current policies.</p>
<p class="title-1">Other Admission Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students who transfer to the University of Nebraska–Lincoln from other accredited colleges or universities and wish to be admitted to the College of Engineering (COE) must meet COE freshman entrance requirements and have a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5 for Nebraska residents or 3.0 for non-residents. Students not meeting either of these requirements must enroll in the Explore Center or another UNL college until they meet COE admission requirements.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The COE accepts courses for transfer for which a C or better grade was received. Although UNL accepts D grades from the University of Nebraska at Kearney and at Omaha, not all majors in the COE accept such low grades. Students must conform to the requirements of their intended major and, in any case, are strongly encouraged to repeat courses with a grade of C- or less.</p>
<p class="basic-text">All transfer students must adopt the curricular requirements of the undergraduate bulletin current at the time of transfer to the COE—not that in use when they entered UNL. Upon admission to UNL, students wishing to pursue degree programs in the COE will be classified and subject to the policies defined in the subsequent section.</p>
<p class="content-box-m-p">ADVISING</p>
<p class="title-1">Academic Advising</p>
<p class="basic-text">Advisers assigned to students are either part of the Engineering Student Services located in the Engineering Library, or are in the student's major department.</p>
<p class="title-1">Student Responsibility</p>
<p class="title-2">Application for the Diploma</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students should access their Degree Audit via MyRed at least once each term to review degree requirements and progress toward graduation. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure their Degree Audit accurately reflects their current College and program of study.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are expected to develop a clear understanding of degree requirements and to plan their course of study with a College adviser. Students requiring clarification of outstanding degree requirements should visit with a College adviser promptly. Students who believe their Degree Audit has errors or omissions should visit with a College adviser promptly. It is important that you resolve these matters as soon as practicable to avoid a delay in graduation.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Each student must submit an Application for Graduation plus $25.00 check or cash fee for each degree to be received to the Office of the University Registrar by:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last Friday in January for May graduation</li>
<li>The last Friday in June for August graduation</li>
<li>The last Friday in September for December graduation</li>
</ul>
<p class="basic-text">An electronic Application for Graduation and payment is available via MyRed. Those students choosing to apply for graduation in person may visit the Office of the University Registrar, 107 Canfield Administration Building. Applications for Graduation submitted in person or by mail must be accompanied by payment. Failure to submit a timely Application for Graduation may preclude the awarding of a degree in the intended term.</p>
<p class="content-box-m-p">ACADEMIC PROGRAMS &amp; POLICIES</p>
<p class="title-1">Honors Program</p>
<p class="title-2">Honor Societies</p>
<p class="basic-text">These recognize students who excel in scholarship and give promise of being leaders in professional areas. They are branches of national societies and are generally open upon invitation to juniors and seniors: Alpha Epsilon (agricultural engineering), Chi Epsilon (civil engineering, both campuses), Eta Kappa Nu (electrical engineering), Pi Tau Sigma (mechanical engineering), Sigma Lambda Chi (construction management), Sigma Xi (scientific, all colleges), Tau Alpha Pi (engineering technology, Omaha campus), and Tau Beta Pi (all engineering).</p>

<p class="basic-text">Students with outstanding scholastic records may obtain the special honor of graduation With Distinction, With High Distinction, or With Highest Distinction upon the recommendation of the faculty of the College. Check with your major department for specific requirements of each degree.</p>
<p class="title-1">Student Standing/Classification/Professional Admission</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Explore Center Pre-Engineering Students.</span> These are students who aspire to enter the College of Engineering but who are not immediately admitted due to not meeting one or more admission criteria such as required high school mathematics, chemistry or physics course(s), ACT, or other qualifications. These students are admitted to the Explore Center and receive advising services from the Engineering Student Services Center. These students may enroll in ENGR 10 and 100-level engineering courses provided they meet the prerequisites on a space-available basis. Once the student has earned a 2.5 cumulative GPA in at least 12 credit hours and has removed all entrance deficiencies they will be admitted to the College of Engineering (COE).</p>
<p class="basic-text">After being admitted to the COE, students wishing to pursue degree programs in the College of Engineering will be classified as described below.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Pre-Professionally Admitted COE Students.</span> These are students who have been admitted to the College of Engineering and are in the process of establishing their academic credentials and confirming their choice of major. Transfer students from other colleges or universities, or from the Explore Center, will be classified as pre-professionally admitted for at least one semester (12 credits) while they confirm their career path and establish their academic credentials (see Professional Admission). Most students are in pre-professionally admitted status for one to four semesters. Pre-professionally admitted students may enroll in upper level engineering courses provided they meet the prerequisites, space is available, and no departmental restrictions exist.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Professionally Admitted COE Students.</span> These students may register in engineering courses where they meet all prerequisites or have permission. A professionally admitted student who wishes to transfer from one COE major to another must re-apply for professional admission to gain professionally admitted status in the new major, subject to the admission criteria of the new major.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students who are enrolled in the Explore Center or in other colleges may enroll only in ENGR 10 and 100-level engineering courses. Those with greater than a 2.5 cumulative GPA may register in upper-level engineering courses, but only on a space-available basis in courses where they meet all prerequisites and have permission of the department. These students may retake an engineering course for C-, D, and F removal no more than once, on a space-available basis and with permission. They may repeat courses with a previous withdrawal (W) only once.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Professional Admission must be earned by a student in order to move from pre-professionally admitted status to professionally admitted status within the College of Engineering. Review of the student’s academic history is completed by the department of the student’s intended major after the student has completed at least 43 credit hours within his or her intended degree program. Additional review criteria are based on the individual degree program and can be found under that major’s information in the undergraduate bulletin.</p>
<p class="basic-text">A student may be reviewed up to two times for professional admission in a single major. If the student is rejected for professional admission on the second review, the student will not be allowed to continue in that major. The student may choose to pursue a new College of Engineering major, but will be subject to the review criteria of the new major. If the student is rejected for professional admission by the new major, the student will be dismissed from the College of Engineering. Further reviews for professional admission will not be allowed and the student will no longer be eligible to enroll in College of Engineering courses.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">College Probation.</span> A student who receives a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of less than a 2.4 will be placed on college probation. The student will remain on probation until a semester is completed with a cumulative GPA at or above 2.4. Any student with two sequential semesters on college probation will be dismissed from the College of Engineering.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The first semester of probation is defined as the semester in which failure to meet a cumulative or semester GPA threshold, a course failure or withdrawal, or a code of conduct violation occurs.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Completion of the following semester (12 credits) with a semester GPA above 2.4 is required for a student to be removed from the college probation. Students may be placed on college probation (or dismissed) for violation of the UNL Student Code of Conduct at any time. A student cannot graduate from the College of Engineering while on college probation.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">College Dismissal.</span> A student will be dismissed from the College of Engineering at the end of any semester in which:</p>
<ul>
<li>The student has been on college probation for two sequential semesters</li>
<li>The student is dismissed by UNL</li>
</ul>
<p class="basic-text">Students may also be dismissed for violating the UNL Student Code of Conduct at any time. College dismissal will cause an administrative change in the student’s matriculation to the Explore Center or to a college indicated by the student. Students who have been dismissed from the College of Engineering may be readmitted (one time only) provided they have removed all academic deficiencies that led to dismissal.</p>
<p class="title-2">General College Policies</p>
<p class="basic-text">These policies are applicable to all students in the College of Engineering:</p>
<p class="list">1. Student priority for entrance into classes for which demand exceeds available class space will be based on accumulative GPA. This priority will be applied at the end of early registration (when applicable).</p>
<p class="list">2. Students may repeat a maximum of three engineering courses. Students may take any one engineering course a maximum of two times.</p>
<p class="list">3. At least 30 of the last 36 credit hours needed for a degree must be registered for and completed at UNL or UNO while identified with the College of Engineering. This means that, practically speaking, the last year of a student’s work must be spent in residence. Credit earned during education abroad may be used toward degree requirements if students participate in prior approved programs and register through UNL (see http://educationabroad.unl.edu).</p>
<p class="list">4. Pass/No Pass courses: Students in the College of Engineering must take ENGR 10, ENGR 20, ENGR 30, and ENGR 400 with the grading option Pass/No Pass. In addition, students may take up to 12 credit hours of courses in the humanities and social sciences on a Pass/No Pass basis. Students in the College of Engineering may not take any other required courses or technical elective courses with the grading option of Pass/No Pass.</p>
<p class="list">5. Credits for “English for Foreign Students who are Non-native Speakers” at UNL and “English as a Second Language” at UNO are not applicable to degree programs in the College of Engineering.</p>
<p class="list">6. Six hours of English composition may be substituted for the written communications requirement in all degree programs.</p>
<p class="list">7. Students who enroll at UNL, UNO, or UNK under the academic year (Fall, Spring, Summer) of this bulletin must fulfill the requirements stated in this UNL bulletin or in any other UNL bulletin which is published while they are enrolled in the College, provided that the bulletin is no more than 10 years old at the time of graduation. A student must, however, meet the graduation requirements from one bulletin only. A student may not choose a portion from one bulletin and the remainder from another bulletin.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Undergraduate Seminars.</span> Freshmen engineering students are required to attend ENGR 10 Freshman Engineering Seminar, a 0 credit course.
