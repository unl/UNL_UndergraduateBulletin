<p class="title-1">Academic Advising</p>
<p class="title-2">Dean’s Office for Undergraduate Programs</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are encouraged to obtain information and advice through the Dean’s Office for Undergraduate Programs, CBA 114.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The staff, which includes both professional staff and peer advisers, are well trained, easily accessible, and can provide academic counseling and answer questions on specific degree requirements, transfer credits, prerequisites, changes in major or college, waivers, procedures or policies, and other available campus services.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Professional Staff:</span> Mark Davis, Jeff Burdic, Betsy Klemme, D’Vee Buss, Megan Friesen, Alison TePoel, Erin Burnette, Ashley Wegener</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Career Services.</span> While staff and faculty advisers may assist in career advising, the College works closely with the University’s Career Services Office to provide assistance to CBA students. Students should schedule time each semester to visit with the Career Coaches located in CBA 138.</p>
<p class="title-1">Student Responsibility</p>
<p class="basic-text">The University of Nebraska–Lincoln and the College of Business Administration are committed to providing effective academic advising to students.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Academic advisers are available to assist students in assessing educational goals, planning programs of study, understanding program requirements, and following policies and procedures.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are ultimately responsible for fulfilling all the requirements of the curriculum in which they are enrolled.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are responsible for initiating advising contacts and preparing for advising sessions.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The mentoring relationship between academic advisers and students is confidential and is strengthened by advisers’ listening with understanding to student concerns.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are expected to take responsibility for a successful university experience and effective advising session. For this to occur the student must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participate in New Student Enrollment, priority registration programs, and any other University/College programs designed to enhance the student-life experience.</li>
<li><span class="no-style-override-1">Review My Degree Audit Report each semester and each time you make a change to your schedule. Schedule appointments with advisers well in advance of priority registration and at other times as needed. Keep appointments and be punctual, or call to reschedule if necessary.</span></li>
<li>Read the appropriate sections of the Undergraduate Bulletin.</li>
<li>Identify specific questions to address prior to meeting with an adviser and be prepared to do long-term planning.</li>
<li>Provide honest and accurate information to the adviser regarding any concerns, questions, special needs, deficiencies or barriers that might affect academic success.</li>
<li>Follow academic policies and procedures and meet academic calendar deadlines (e.g. registration, fee payment, degree audit, filing for degree, etc.).</li>
<li>Know and complete program requirements.</li>
<li>Seek assistance from the various student support services provided by the University and College.</li>
<li>Immediately notify the University of any change in postal address, email address, and/or phone number.</li>
</ul>
<p class="content-box-m-p">ACADEMIC PROGRAMS &amp; POLICIES</p>
<p class="title-1">Academic Load</p>
<ul>
<li>A maximum of 19 credit hours (including online and independent study courses through On-line and Distance Education) may be taken each semester without special permission from the Dean’s Office for Undergraduate Programs. The summer sessions have a maximum load of 15 hours. The three week session limit is 3 hours and each five week session has a 7 hour limit.</li>
<li>A minimum of 12 credit hours must be taken each semester to remain a full time student.</li>
</ul>
<p class="basic-text">To complete the requirements for a degree in eight semesters, a student must earn an average of 15 credit hours each semester. Most students need a minimum of two hours of preparation for every hour in class, so a schedule of 15 credit hours is actually equivalent to a 45 hour a week job (15 classroom + 30 preparation).</p>
<p class="basic-text">The student who must work or one who may need additional study time, should plan to take a lighter load and consider taking some summer sessions or an extra semester or two to complete the work required for a degree. In the event that a student’s cumulative grade point average falls below 2.5, a lighter academic load may be required.</p>
<p class="title-1">Course Exclusions and Restrictions</p>
<p class="basic-text">No credit for graduation is allowed for non-college level courses or for courses that deal primarily with the development of skills including the following:</p>

<p class="title-1">Student Recognition</p>
<p class="title-2">Dean’s List/Degrees with Distinction/Scholarships</p>
<p class="title-3">Dean’s List</p>
<p class="basic-text">The College recognizes students for academic achievement during the fall and spring semesters by placement on the College Dean’s List. To qualify for the Dean’s List, students must complete 12 or more credit hours for a grade (excluding hours with P, NP, NR and I marks) during the semester and attain a grade point average of 3.6 or higher.</p>
<p class="title-3">Degrees with Distinction</p>
<p class="basic-text">In recognition of outstanding academic excellence, the college recommends the bachelors degree <span class="basic-text-ital">With Distinction</span>, <span class="basic-text-ital">With High Distinction</span>, and <span class="basic-text-ital">With Highest Distinction</span>. Students are recommended for this honor by the Scholarship, Honors, and Awards Committee of the College.</p>
<p class="basic-text">To be eligible for consideration students must:</p>
<ul>
<li>complete 45 credit hours for a letter grade (excluding Pass/No Pass marks) at UNL prior to the semester in which they graduate, and</li>
<li>must have completed 60 such credit hours at UNL at the time they graduate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="basic-text">To determine the level of distinction, the Committee uses the cumulative grade point average based on all credit hours taken at UNL prior to the beginning of the term in which the student receives his or her degree. No specific cumulative grade point average is required but the honor is limited to approximately ten percent of the graduating class. This usually means a 3.8 (or higher) GPA. Students will be notified of the distinction, high, or highest distinction designation approximately one month before graduation.</p>
<p class="title-1">International Study/Education Abroad</p>
<p class="title-2">Education Abroad</p>

<p class="content-box-m-p">ACE REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p class="basic-text">All students must fulfill the Achievement Centered Education (ACE) requirements. Information about the ACE program may be viewed at ace.unl.edu. Students may also use the Bulletin’s course search facility to search for ACE groups. Example: Enter ACE one in the search to generate a list of all possible ACE 1 courses.</p>
<p class="title-1">ACE Achievement-Centered Education—Ten Courses (normally 30 hours)</p>
<p class="basic-text">This is the university’s innovative, outcomes-focused general education component designed to enhance the undergraduate experience by providing broad exposure to multiple disciplines, complementing the major and helping students develop important reasoning, inquiry, and civic capacities.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph">Important rules to remember when selecting course work to meet this requirement:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are 10 ACE Student Learning Outcomes (SLO) and at least one course, equivalent to 3 credit hours, must be taken for each of the 10 SLO’s.</li>
<li>Up to three ACE Student Learning Outcomes (SLO), 4-10, may be satisfied by work in one subject area;</li>
<li>ACE SLO’s must be satisfied by work in at least three subject areas;</li>
<li>No ACE course may satisfy more than one ACE SLO in a student’s program;</li>
<li>If an ACE course addresses two ACE SLO’s, the student decides which one of the two outcomes the course will satisfy in that student’s program. (My Degree Audit will make an automatic decision based on first course taken; first SLO needed.)</li>
<li>As part of the college requirements of non-business and business courses, many courses will also work for ACE. Students should carefully review required course work with ACE options to make the best use of courses to fulfill both degree requirements as well as UNL ACE requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p class="content-box-m-p">BULLETIN TO USE</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students (including transfer students) must follow the Undergraduate Bulletin in effect when they <span class="basic-text-bold">enroll</span> in the College of Business Administration. Students who leave the college and return or those applying for ‘readmission’ to the College are subject to requirements in place at the time of their <span class="basic-text-bold">re-enrollment</span> in the College.</p>
<p class="content-box-m-p">COLLEGE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p class="title-1">Professional Enhancement Program (PrEP) (4 hours)</p>
<p class="basic-text">Designed to develop professional,confident and polished students for lifelongcareer success, the PrEP program consists of four required one hour courses. These courses are labeled BSAD 111, BSAD 222, BSAD 333, BSAD 444 and are offered across the four year curriculum. Raikes students complete this requirement as a part of their other courses.</p>
<p class="title-1">College General Education Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">The curriculum requirements for the College consist of course work in three areas.</p>
<p class="basic-text">All course work (except electives and where otherwise noted) must be taken for a grade.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The three areas include the following:</p>
<p class="list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">Non-Business Requirements (NBR)</span></p>
<p class="list-indent">– which consist primarily of College and University ACE (Achievement-Centered Education) course work</p>
<p class="list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">Business Core</span></p>

<p class="title-1">Non-Business Requirements (NBR)</p>
<p class="basic-text-no-indent"><span class="basic-text-bold">(Most of the ACE requirements)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Eight Courses (normally 24-26 hours)</li>
<li>All students in the College of Business Administration will take the following non-business courses (unless otherwise noted).</li>
<li>While NBR 1, 2, 7 and 8 identify specific ACE options to choose from or identify an ACE course specifically required for the College, NBR 3, 4, 5, and 6 allow for students to select courses according to their personal interests (and meet ACE 4, 5, 7, and 9).</li>
<li>Most students will take course work to fulfill these requirements during the freshman/sophomore year. However, if hours are still needed during the junior/senior year, there may also be options to ‘double count’ course work for NBR 3 (ACE 4) and/or NBR 6 (ACE 9) toward the major (BCA-M) or a minor. This is likely to be of most benefit to ‘transfer-in students’ due to the nature of the program and when ACE requirements are traditionally taken.</li>
<li>All course work for NBR must be taken for a grade.</li>
</ul>
<p class="title-2">NBR 1: Written Communication (ACE 1)</p>
<p class="basic-text-no-indent"><span class="basic-text-ital">Choose ONE of the following:</span></p>

</ul>
<p class="title-3">Math Placement Exam (MPE)</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students admitted to the College of Business Administration are required to take a Math Placement Examination prior to enrolling in the college math requirement of MATH 104 or MATH 106 (or higher math).</p>
<ul>
<li>The results of this examination determine which math course students will enroll in their first semester on campus.</li>
<li>Students lacking sufficient high school preparation in math may need to enroll in equivalent high school preparatory courses, as will be determined by the MPE.</li>

<p class="basic-text">Students enrolling for their first semester with junior standing (or more), will see that the list of approved courses includes a few business courses. While this section is labeled “non-business requirements,” students may elect to enroll in one of the business courses to fulfill the ACE 9 requirement as long as prerequisites are completed (which are generally reserved for juniors or seniors). Work closely with your adviser to bring this to their attention and to question how this course may potentially satisfy other degree program requirements, including the major. The options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>ACTS majors – must complete an International Business Course as part of the degree requirements. Actuarial science majors may choose to take ECON 321 International Economics to fulfill the IBCR as well as the global awareness requirement (NBR 6–ACE 9).</li>
<li>ABUS majors – AECN 346, AECN 367, AECN 420, AECN 425, AGRI 282, ENSC 110, HORT 200, may be taken to fulfill the global awareness requirement (NBR 6–ACE 9) as well as a requirement for the major.</li>
<li>BSAD majors – ECON 321, MNGT 365, MNGT 414 may be taken to fulfill the global awareness requirement (NBR 6–ACE 9) as well as a requirement for the major. (ECON 321 and MNGT 414 are also IBCR course options.)</li>
<li>ECON majors – ECON 321 may be taken to fulfill the global awareness requirement (NBR 6–ACE 9) as well as a requirement for the major. (ECON 321 is also an IBCR option.)</li>
<li>IBUS majors – ECON 321 or MNGT 414 may be taken to fulfill the global awareness requirement (NBR 6–ACE 9) as well as a requirement for the major. (Both are also IBCR options.)</li>
<li>MNGT majors – MNGT 365, MNGT 414 may be taken to fulfill the global awareness requirement (NBR 6–ACE 9) and may be able to fulfill a requirement for the major depending on the option selected. (MNGT 414 is also an IBCR option.)</li>
<li>An alternative to the above options is allowance of the course to count for NBR 6–ACE 9 and the associated minor—but only one or the other (major OR minor).</li>
</ul>
<p class="header-paragraph">In any of the above instances where a double counting is an option, only 3 hours of credit are awarded; student will still need to meet the 120 hours for graduation.</p>

<li>Taught via Blackboard – all components must be completed to a satisfactory level to graduate.</li>
<li>Major Field Test required as part of assessment, which must be passed to graduate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="title-1">Electives – Hours vary to meet 120 hour minimum to graduate</p>
<p class="basic-text">Electives round out the rest of the 120 hour curriculum where students have the option to choose courses toward a second major, a dual degree, a minor (or two); or, students can simply select courses of personal interest.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some hours may need to be additional business course work (to meet the requirement that 60 hours of course work be in business). This requirement will vary by major.</li>
<li>There may be a need to enroll in an international business course requirement (IBCR) if not taken as part of the major or for the business elective(s) requirement.</li>
<li>A minimum of 12 hours of 300/400 upper-level course work beyond the business core is required for most majors to ensure depth is achieved through enrollment in elective hours. See 300/400-level Elective Requirement below for additional information.</li>
<li>In addition to the Foundation, leadership, and computer science foundation courses listed earlier, RAIKES students will also complete the following courses as part of the degree requirements:</li>
<li>Raikes Design Studio Courses <span class="basic-text-ital">(must be taken for a grade)</span>:</li>
<li>RAIK 301H, RAIK 302H, RAIK 401H, RAIK 402H (ACE 10)</li>
<li>Raikes Computer Science Electives – Choose 6 hours from: CSCE 378, CSCE 475, CSCE 476 or RAIK 384H <span class="basic-text-ital">(can be taken Pass/No Pass)</span></li>
<li><span class="basic-text-ital"></span>If not completed through the other area requirements, any remaining ACE requirements will need to be completed as required electives.</li>
<li>In a 21-hour major, students will average 32 hours of elective credit; 2nd major options and/or minors may be appropriate to consider for elective hours.</li>
</ul>
<p class="title-1">Other Requirements</p>
<p class="title-2">International Business Course Requirement (IBCR)</p>
<ul>
<li>The international business course requirement (IBCR) is to broaden the student’s international perspective.</li>
<li>Each student, excluding accounting majors, must include one course which emphasizes an international perspective.</li>
<li>Actuarial Science majors are encouraged to take FINA 450 if they have not met this requirement with completion of NBR 6 – ACE 9 with ECON 321 or MNGT 414.</li>
<li>The IBCR must be taken for a grade.</li>
</ul>
<p class="header-paragraph">The course must be chosen from the following approved list of International Business Course Requirement (IBCR) courses. Many of these courses have prerequisites. Some are restricted for education abroad and others may only be offered once a year. Thus, you are advised to plan ahead in scheduling this requirement into your program.</p>
<p class="title-3">IBCR Courses</p>
<p class="list">BSAD 491 International Studies in Business and Economics (1-15 hrs)</p>
<ul>
<li>Available only to students studying abroad for which there is no UNL equivalent course.</li>
<li>Available also for the Senshu, Japan, CIMBA Italy, and for the China Education Abroad Programs.</li>
<li>Senshu program students may apply 3 hours towards electives in the FINA, MNGT, or MRKT major; 6 hours applicable for BSAD or IBUS major/minor.</li>
<li>BSAD 491 credit from any other study abroad program should be based on course topics directly associated with a specific major in MNGT, MRKT or FINA, and may need department consent. Students should visit with an academic adviser for assistance.</li>
</ul>
<p class="list">ECON 321 Introduction to International Economics <span class="list-ital">(If not completed at this point, MNGT 414 may double count for ACE 9.)</span></p>

<p class="list">ECON 440 Regional Development</p>
<p class="list">ECON 487 Economies in Transition</p>
<p class="basic-text">If planned carefully, the IBCR course can count in two places. It is not an extra 3 hours of credit, but rather, is 3 hours embedded within other requirements. If selected carefully, it can also count for 3 hours of credit in the major (i.e. MRKT 453 counts for MRKT elective in MRKT major and would count for the IBCR; FINA 450 counts for FINA elective in FINA major and would fulfill the IBCR as well; etc.). On the other hand, if course work for the major is already determined by personal choices, the IBCR can count in electives, and more specifically, for one of the ‘business’ electives needed for most majors.</p>
<p class="title-2">300/400 Upper-level Requirement</p>
<p class="basic-text-no-indent">As part of the degree requirements, all students must complete 12 hours of 300/400 level course work.</p>
<p class="basic-text">This can be business or non-business course work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Business course work from the Business Core Intermediate (BCI), Business Core Advanced-Major (FIRST Major) or Business Core Advanced-Capstone may NOT be used to fulfill this requirement with exceptions noted below:</li>
<li>If more than 21 hours of course work for the major are taken at the 300/400-level and of those hours, course work is not being double counted toward the NBR and major, the additional 300/400-level hours can be used to fulfill the 300/400-level requirement. You will need to consult your Degree Audit to determine your requirements.</li>
<li>BSAD majors will complete a 24 hour major and only need to complete 9 upper level hours.</li>
<li>FINA majors, will take between 24 and 30 hours for their major; consult the major section in this document or your Degree Audit to determine how many hours will double count for this requirement. This will depend on which option you select for the major.</li>
<li>Actuarial science, agribusiness majors, international business majors and RAIKES students do not need to meet this requirement due to the additional hours at the 300/400 level required for the major/program.</li>
<li>Business Core Advanced-Major course work used for a SECOND major (if picked), or course work selected for a minor MAY count.</li>
<li>Non-business course work (NBR) taken at the 300/400 level may be double counted to fulfill this requirement if it is not being used to double count for the 1st major.</li>
<li>No course may be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis unless it is 398/399 credit. Only 3 hours of 398/399 is allowed for this requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p class="title-2">Business Course/Business Elective Hours</p>
<p class="basic-text">Sixty (60) hours of business courses are required for the BSBA degree.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The required hours WILL VARY BY MAJOR, dependent on how requirements have been accepted and/or completed throughout the previous components of the program. While <span class="basic-text-bold">GENERAL MINIMUM</span> guidelines by major are noted below, My Degree Audit will specify <span class="basic-text-ital">minimum business</span> credit hour expectations for each student. You will generally see this addressed under the ELECTIVE section (BUSINESS ELECTIVES) on My Degree Audit.</p>
<ul>
<li>ACCT, ECON, MRKT majors – 3 hours</li>
<li>BSAD – no additional business course work as your major consists of 24 hours of business course work</li>
<li>ACTS – no additional business course work as your major consists of 28 hours of business course work.</li>
<li>FINA – no additional business course work as your major consists of 24-28 hours of business course work. UNLESS you select AECN 495A under the Banking and Financial Institutions options, and then you will need 3 hours of business electives.</li>
<li>ABUS and RAIK – no additional business course work required due to intent of major as being ‘business-related’ course work.</li>
<li>Additional hours may be required if there is a variation in hours for NBR, BCF, BCI or BCA, or if there is a violation of the 75% rule, the 15 hour rule, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p class="header-paragraph">Course work must be taken for a grade except for 398/399 options where grades are generally not permitted</p>
<p class="title-1">Foreign Languages/Language Requirement</p>
<p class="basic-text">Other than meeting the minimum requirement for admission to the University, the College does not require any additional work in foreign languages except for the international business major. Students, however, are always encouraged to take language courses.</p>
<p class="title-1">Minimum Hours Required for Graduation</p>
<p class="basic-text">A minimum of 120 semester hours of credit is required for graduation; more may be necessary if specific degree requirements have not yet been completed. Most students will graduate with 121 hours as BSAD 150 is not applicable toward degree requirements.</p>
<p class="title-1">Grade Rules</p>
<p class="title-2">C- and D Grades</p>
<p class="basic-text">While students may earn grades of C- or D, there are restrictions and recommendations for such grades and further enrollment options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grade of C or higher in ACCT 201 required to enroll in ACCT 202.</li>
<li>Grade of C or higher in ACCT 202 required to enroll in any 300/400-level ACCT course.</li>
<li>Grade of C or higher required in other departmental higher-level sequencing courses (i.e. MATH 101 to take MATH 104, etc.). See course descriptions to determine enrollment restrictions.</li>
<li>Minimum 2.5 cumulative GPA required to enroll in many business courses.</li>
<li>ACCT 201, ACCT 202, ECON 215, FINA 361, BLAW 371, BLAW 372, MNGT 331, MNGT 350/SCMS 350, MNGT 360, MNGT 475, MRKT 341, MRKT 350</li>
<li>Grades of C- or lower can be removed by retaking the course at UNL or within the University system (UNK, UNO).</li>
<li>Grades of C or better are required to transfer courses from other institutions.</li>
<li>Academic bankruptcy options may be considered for students who have one or two semesters of poor performance.</li>
</ul>
<p class="title-2">Pass/No Pass Limits</p>
<p class="basic-text">The Pass/No Pass option is designed for students who want to study areas or topics in which they may have minimum preparation. If used for this purpose, the option can enrich the student’s academic experience without lowering the student’s grade point average. Several restrictions apply when considering the Pass/No Pass option:</p>
<ul>
<li>BSAD 111 and BSAD 150 are offered only as Pass/No Pass. Both are required and BSAD 150 does not count toward the 120 hours required for the degree</li>
<li>Students may apply no more than 6 hours of elective credit using the Pass/No Pass option (excludes BSAD 111, BSAD 150, BSAD 222, BSAD 333, BSAD 444).</li>
<li><span class="basic-text-bold">No</span> student in <span class="basic-text-bold">any</span> College enrolled at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln may take business courses in the College of Business Administration using the Pass/No Pass option.</li>
<li>College of Business Administration students may <span class="basic-text-bold">NOT</span> take course work to satisfy ACE requirements, the International Business Course Requirement (IBCR), nor <span class="basic-text-bold">any</span> required business course work, including the major and minor, using the Pass/No Pass option.</li>
<li>Students majoring in actuarial science through the College of Business Administration may <span class="basic-text-bold">NOT</span> take any math, actuarial science, or required courses using the Pass/No Pass option.</li>
<li>Students taking courses to fulfill the requirements of a minor in an area of study outside the College of Business Administration are subject to CBA rules restricting use of the Pass/No Pass option if courses in their minor are used to meet ACE or any college-specific requirements.</li>
<li>Students seeking any minor outside the College should verify rules applying to minimum grade expectations and Pass/No Pass options with the adviser for their minor as additional restrictions may apply and they often vary.</li>
<li>Students from UNO/UNK/UNMC and from other institutions are subject to the same restrictions listed here of UNL students.</li>
</ul>
<p class="header-paragraph">Exceptions to the above rules are limited to the following and no other exceptions will be made.</p>
<ul>
<li>An independent study course (398, 399) may be taken in the College of Business Administration using the Pass/No Pass option with the permission of the instructor and the department chair but College of Business Administration students who qualify for this exception may use the independent study course (398, 399) <span class="basic-text-bold">only</span> as elective credit.</li>
<li>Advanced Placement grades of P and Credit By Exam grades of P will be accepted to fulfill degree requirements (with the exception of BSAD 150). These hours will not count against the 6-hour-maximum hours permitted.</li>
<li>Students who travel abroad and return with “credit” rather than grades from the institution where they studied may use P grades to fulfill degree requirements. These hours will not count against the 9-hour-maximum number of hours permitted.</li>
</ul>
<p class="title-2">GPA Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">A 2.5 cumulative grade point average is required to apply for graduation, as well as a requirement for enrollment in ACCT 201 and ACCT 202, ECON 215, BLAW 371 and BLAW 372, FINA 361, MNGT 331, MNGT 360, MNGT 475, MNGT 350/SCMS 350 or MRKT 350, and MRKT 341. In some instances, a specific grade is required in certain courses to continue with upper-level course work.</p>
<p class="title-1">Transfer Credit Rules</p>
<p class="basic-text"><span class="no-style-override-1">See Maximum/Minimum hour restrictions under Course Exclusions and Restrictions</span></p>
<p class="title-1">Course Level Requirements (Hour Requirement 300+)</p>
<p class="basic-text">In addition to the Business Core Intermediate and Business Core Advanced and Business Course Advanced Capstone requirements, business students must complete an additional 12 hours of 300/400-level course work in their program (not required for ACTS majors and RAIKES students). Students generally fulfill this requirement through their electives, but there may be a few upper-class students who can fulfill the requirement with the ACE course requirements. Twelve hours is based on a 21 hour major. The number is adjusted when there are larger majors.</p>
<p class="title-1">Residency</p>
<ul>
<li>At least 30 of the last 36 hours of credit must be registered for and completed in residence at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.</li>
<li>Students electing to study abroad in their final semester are exempted for the hours earned abroad, but no additional hours may be transferred in the last 36 hours. This exemption requires filing a written appeal in the Undergraduate Programs office.</li>

<p class="basic-text">Given the number of elective hours available to most CBA students, consideration should be given to the opportunity to pursue a dual degree, which allows simultaneous enrollment in CBA and another college on campus. Students will need to consult with both colleges to ensure all requirements are satisfied in a timely, efficient manner and that double counting of course (where appropriate) is identified in advance of enrollment.</p>
<p class="content-box-m-p">MINORS &amp; AREAS OF SPECIALIZATIONS OFFERED</p>
<p class="title-1">Minors Outside the College</p>
<p class="basic-text">The faculty of the College encourages students to minor in a discipline outside the College to develop logical and critical thinking, curiosity, understanding of the external environment and sensitivity to ethical issues. By developing these abilities, students can enrich their lives and provide a broader basis for informed and responsible decision making.</p>
<ul>
<li>Minors are not required; only recommended.</li>
<li>Course work for the minor may be counted for the minor and ACE if so designated as ACE.</li>
<li>“PLAN A” requires completion of one minor; “Plan B” requires two minors be completed.</li>
<li>The actuarial science minor is NOT an option for a FINA major.</li>

<p class="title-1">Sales Certificate</p>
<p class="basic-text">The ability to sell is a universal skillset and there is some form of selling involved in almost every job. Students who are interested in developing their sales skills and potentially pursuing a career in sales can get a certificate or advanced certificate in sales through the Center for Sales Excellence in the College of Business Administration (CBA). The sales certificate program is open to all UNL undergraduates – students do not have to be CBA majors/minors to be a part of this program.</p>
<p class="basic-text">To pursue the certificate or advanced certificate, all students must first take MRKT 257 Sales Communication (3 cr). This prerequisite class introduces students to the fundamentals of the sales communication process. MRKT 257 also meets the ACE 2 communication requirement. Following this class, interested students can apply for admission into the sales certificate program. Selected students will need to take the following courses to obtain a Certificate in Sales Excellence:</p>
<p class="list">MRKT 357 Advanced Professional Selling (3 cr)</p>
<p class="list">MRKT 371 Sales Practicum I (1 cr)</p>
<p class="list">MRKT 457 Customer Relationship Management (3 cr)</p>
<p class="list">MRKT 458 Sales Force Management (3 cr)</p>
<p class="header-paragraph-title">After taking these courses, students interested in earning an Advanced Certificate in Sales Excellence must take the following additional course:</p>
<p class="list">MRKT 460 Key Account Selling (3 cr)&lt;</p>
<p class="header-paragraph">The certificate and advanced certificate will be awarded by CBA. Both complement the student’s existing major/minor and serve as a formal recognition that the student has satisfactorily completed the aforementioned course requirements. Certificates will not be listed on the student’s transcripts. However, given the value of the certificates’ curricula to prospective employers, students will benefit by mentioning these certificates on their resume.</p>
