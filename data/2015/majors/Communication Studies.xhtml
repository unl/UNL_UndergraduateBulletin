<p class="basic-text">Communication studies is a social science and humanistic field of study, research, and application. The mission of the Department of Communication Studies is to examine human symbolic activity as it shapes and is shaped by relationships, institutions, and societies. This work concerns how, why, and with what effects people communicate through verbal and nonverbal messages. Through research, teaching, and service, the Department devotes particular attention to understanding the ways in which communication erodes and sustains collaboration within and among local, national, and global communities.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Communication competencies are among those most highly desired in professional, personal, organizational, and civic arenas. Additionally, a major in Communication Studies goes beyond learning communication skills by fostering a world view that demonstrates a commitment to communication, collaboration, and community. Communication Studies majors go on to careers in sales, marketing, human resources, customer service, nonprofit management, event planning, fund raising, public relations, management, and government, to name just a few. Majors also go on to graduate school and law school.</p>
<p class="title-2">University Debate and Forensics</p>
<p class="basic-text">The University of Nebraska–Lincoln offers a nationally recognized debate and forensics program of participation in campus and intercollegiate debate, public speaking, and interpretation events. The program gives students the opportunity to compete at the local, state, regional, and national level. No previous debate or speech experience is required. All students who are in good standing may take part in intercollegiate debate and forensics.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Work.</span> Graduate programs leading to the master of arts and doctor of philosophy degrees are offered in the department. A detailed description of these programs appears in the Graduate Studies Bulletin.</p>
