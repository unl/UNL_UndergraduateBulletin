<p class="faculty-list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">Chair: Sherri Jones,</span> 301 Barkley Memorial Center</p>
<p class="basic-text">The program in Speech-Language Pathology and Audiology is housed in the Department of Special Education and Communication Disorders in the College of Education and Human Sciences. The program offers both a bachelor of arts degree and a bachelor of science degree through the College of Arts and Sciences and a bachelor of science degree through the College of Education and Human Sciences. Both degrees provide the preprofessional courses required for graduate study in either speech-language pathology or audiology. The entry level for practice as a speech-language pathologist requires a masters degree. A doctorate of audiology (AuD) is required to practice audiology. For information on programs leading to degrees and for a detailed description of courses required, please see the College of Education and Human Sciences section of this bulletin.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Teacher certification in speech-language pathology requires a masters degree with specialization in speech-language pathology, passing scores on the Pre-Professional Skills Test, satisfactory completion of EDPS 250, EDPS 251, or CYAF 160, EDPS 362 and SLPA 488 or TEAC 330 or the graduate-level equivalents.
