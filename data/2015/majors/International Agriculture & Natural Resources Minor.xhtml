<p class="basic-text">The International Agriculture and Natural Resources minor is designed for students who seek a broad understanding of the nature and role of agriculture and natural resources in the integrated world economy and of the implications of world events for agriculture and natural resources in both the United States and abroad. The minor adds a global perspective to professional preparation. It is for students who desire a broad understanding of international trade and development issues as well as for those seeking employment in business firms or government agencies with international operations or interests.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">REQUIREMENTS FOR MINOR OFFERED BY DEPARTMENT</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students regularly build their minor program from courses organized around three key areas: 1) a group of international courses in CASNR <span class="basic-text-ital">(listed below)</span>; 2) complimentary international courses offered in arts and sciences*; and 3) optional but highly recommended modern language instruction or experience as a base for building international communications skills. Two minor plans are available. One plan requires 12 credits in courses at or above the 300 level while the other plan requires 18 credits, including a minimum of 6 credits in courses at or above the 300 level.</p>
<p class="asterisk">* <span class="basic-text-ital">Complimentary international courses in arts and sciences can be found at the website: http://bulletin.unl.edu/undergraduate/major/Global+Studies under the headings ‘Regional Specialization’ and ‘Thematic Specialization.’</span></p>

<p class="basic-text">A student, in consultation with the academic advisor and a minor advisor (chosen from those above), prepares a list of courses on the CASNR Revision of Minor form, obtains the appropriate signatures and submits the minor form to the minor coordinator prior to the deadline for submitting the application for graduation. While students may apply during their senior year, planning for the minor and application are recommended earlier in order to get maximum benefit from the minor.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Upon approval, the minor program will be forwarded to the Office of the University Registrar, with a copy supplied to the student’s college. The minor will be recorded on the student’s transcript upon graduation. Students interested in pursuing an International Agriculture and Natural Resources minor should contact the minor coordinator, Jon Kerrigan, or the CASNR Dean’s Office, 103 Agricultural Hall.</p>
