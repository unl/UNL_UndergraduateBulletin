<p class="basic-text">The undergraduate national security studies minor (NSST) is an interdisciplinary program that provides undergraduates across campus (any department or college) with relevant knowledge of various aspects of global security and the theory and analytical skills necessary for dealing with global security studies issues. Students interested in national security issues, security-related job opportunities, or a desire to have a set of analytical skills relevant to global issues will benefit from the NSST. Students who have completed the NSST requirements will, upon graduation, receive a minor in national security studies.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The minor requires 21 credit hours of course work with a grade of B- or better, including a 3 credit hour capstone course (NSST 475).</p>
