<p class="basic-text">Electrical engineering is concerned with the production, transmission, and utilization of electrical energy and the transmission and processing of information. Employment opportunities for electrical engineers cover a wide spectrum of activities including design, development, research, sales, and management. These activities are carried on in industrial organizations, public and private utilities, the communications and computer industry, governmental and educational institutions, and consulting engineering firms. The objective of this major is to offer students an education to become productive electrical engineers and be active, contributing citizens of the nation and the world.</p>
<p class="basic-text">This department has over 25 faculty involved in research related to electronic materials, nanotechnology, optical systems, communications, biomedical applications, signal processing, microelectronics design, energy systems, and electromagnetics. Students are encouraged to participate in research activities, and have opportunities to travel and present their research results.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The department has extensive research facilities for all areas including state of the art computing facilities, integrated circuits and systems research facilities, communications and signal-processing laboratories, applied electromagnetics research, solid state laboratories, nanostructures research, electro-optics research and energy systems laboratories.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The curriculum is designed to provide a broad education in fundamental principles and laboratory applications, and an awareness of the socioeconomic impact of technology. Technical electives are normally selected from advanced courses in electrical engineering to provide for specialization in selected areas. However, technical electives can also be selected from courses offered by other departments of the College of Engineering or from appropriate physics, chemistry, mathematics, and biological sciences courses.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The department administers a network of high-end UNIX workstations and PCs, upgraded regularly, and used for classroom instruction as well as the individual needs of students.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR DEPARTMENT ADMISSION</p>
<p class="basic-text">Requirements for admission to the Department of Electrical Engineering will be granted if he/she has:</p>
<ul>
<li>maintained a cumulative GPA of at least 2.4 and is in good standing in the College of Engineering, and,</li>
<li>completed ELEC 215 and ELEC 216 with a grade of C or better.</li>
</ul>

<p class="header-paragraph">A transfer student will be admitted if he/she has:</p>
<ul>
<li>completed courses equivalent to ELEC 215 and ELEC 216 at other institutions with acceptable transfer grades of C or better, and,</li>
<li>a GPA of 2.4 or better during their first 12 credit hours in electrical engineering course work at UNL.</li>
</ul>

<p class="header-paragraph">Transfer students will be able to appeal to the advisors for admission if they fail to meet the GPA requirement for an additional semester.</p>
