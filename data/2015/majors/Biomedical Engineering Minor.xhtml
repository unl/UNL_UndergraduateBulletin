<p class="title-2">This minor is for engineering majors ONLY.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph">The College of Engineering enables its students to participate in this approved minor subject to the following conditions:</p>
<p class="list">1. A minor will not reduce or alter the existing course or degree requirements for students electing to pursue a minor.</p>
<p class="list">2. A student’s minor program must be organized and approved by an adviser prior to the submission of the senior check to the department chair or head.</p>
<p class="list">3. The minor must be approved by the adviser, the department chair or head, the Dean and the cognizant program offering the minor.</p>
<p class="list">4. The College of Engineering will follow the “Plan A/B” format of the Arts and Sciences College in which a student pursuing a single minor must complete the “Plan A” requirements. A student pursuing a double (or greater) minor must fulfill either the “Plan A” or “Plan B” requirements for both minors depending on which plan is offered by the cognizant department.</p>
<p class="list">5. Minors on the Lincoln or Omaha campuses may be added by approval of the College of Engineering Curriculum Committee and faculty.</p>
