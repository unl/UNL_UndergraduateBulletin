<p class="basic-text">The microbiology major is an interdepartmental major that offers educational opportunities in various areas of microbiology leading to a bachelor of science degree in microbiology. The training offered is suitable for a professional career in microbiology, which may lead to employment in the food industry, clinical microbiology, biotechnology, and pharmaceuticals; or federal agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Public Health Service, and Environmental Protection Agency. The program is also suitable as preparation for graduate studies leading to academic careers and professional careers in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, pharmacy, and health-related fields. (Completion of the microbiology baccalaureate degree program does not automatically fulfill the admission requirements for application to a given professional program. Students considering application to a professional program are strongly encouraged to work with their adviser to ensure that admission requirements are met during completion of the microbiology degree.)</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students interested in majoring in microbiology are advised to make an appointment with the academic adviser.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students concerned about their preparation for college-level biology should take LIFE 120 with an understanding that they will need to use the resource center and plan their time accordingly to allow for increased study time. Please consult your adviser if in doubt.</p>
