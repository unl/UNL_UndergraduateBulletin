The bachelor's degree program in psychology can also prepare you for diverse careers in such applied fields as counseling, business, and health and human services. If you plan to major in psychology, we recommend that you meet with our Chief Advisers as early as possible to plan a program of study consistent with your interests and goals.</p>
