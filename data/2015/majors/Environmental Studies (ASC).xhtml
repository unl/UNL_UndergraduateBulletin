<p class="basic-text">The environmental studies major is designed for students who want to make a difference and contribute to solving current as well as future environmental challenges on a local to global scale. Solutions to such problems as climate change, pollution, and resource conservation require individuals who have a broad-based knowledge in the natural sciences, social sciences, and the humanities as well as strength in a specific discipline. The Environmental Studies program uses a holistic approach and a framework of sustainability. This framework recognizes the necessity of meeting current resource needs without compromising the environment and the ability of future generations to meet their needs. The environmental studies major provides students with a degree and the skills to work across disciplines and to be competitive in the job market. Students will acquire a broad-based education in the physical, biological, and social sciences and develop competency in a specific discipline.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students may select a BS or BA track through the College of Arts and Sciences or a BS track through the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources. The degree program consists of four required components:</p>
<p class="numbered-list">1. Every major must complete the set of environmental studies core courses that provide breadth in the scientific and human dimensions of environmental issues and challenges (ENVR 201 and ENVR 249). In addition, students will have the opportunity to interact and work with individuals and organizations involved in environmental issues within the community (ENVR 319).</p>
<p class="numbered-list">2. Students complete a set of general collateral course requirements in the natural sciences (biology, chemistry and physics), Earth systems, geospatial sciences, mathematics, statistics, and in the humanities and social sciences (Human Dimension). These requirements provide students the opportunity to explore Earth and Ecological Systems: Understand the structure, function, and interaction among Earth’s four major spheres: land, water, living things, and air in the context of the physical, geological, and biological processes as well as human influences and their variability over space and time. These requirements also provide students with an opportunity to learn about the human dimensions of environmental challenges that involve law, politics, ethics, economics, historical setting, cultural diversity public policy, decision-making, and risk assessment at local to global scales with emphasis on environmentally sustainable development. In addition, students will use and apply relevant field, laboratory, geospatial, and social science research methods, tools and technologies to address environmental challenges in an ethical manner.</p>
<p class="numbered-list">3. After 52 hours of course work, majors are strongly encouraged to develop an individual course of study plan in collaboration with the environmental studies academic adviser and/or director that specifically defines an emphasis area that will provide depth in one of the following areas: anthropology, biology, chemistry, communication studies, english, geography, geology, meteorology-climatology, political science, psychology, or sociology (through the College of Arts and Sciences); or applied climate science, leadership and entrepreneurship, or natural resources (through the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources).</p>
<p class="numbered-list">4. After earning 88 credit hours, students must complete a “capstone” senior thesis (ENVR 499A and ENVR 499B) with permission of the program director and under the guidance of a faculty adviser with expertise in their chosen area of emphasis.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The environmental studies program has a 1 credit hour internship course (ENVR 497) requirement which provides the opportunity to gain work experience in an off-campus setting related to a student’s academic and career objectives. Advanced students are encouraged to explore this possibility with the adviser in their area of emphasis and with the Program Director.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students interested in majoring in environmental studies through the College of Arts and Sciences are advised to make an initial appointment with the program or academic adviser. Those interested in pursuing a natural resources emphasis or applied climate science emphasis should see the program director also.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Once a student has selected an area of emphasis, advising regarding the emphasis will be done through the appropriate department. However, the program director will continue to be the student’s degree adviser.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students interested in obtaining a minor in environmental studies needs to visit with the environmental studies academic adviser to establish a course of study plan that consists of course work relevant to students interests and goals.</p>
