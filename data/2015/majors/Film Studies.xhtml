<p class="basic-text">The film studies program is housed in the Department of English. The program is centered on a core curriculum of four courses in the history of film, film genre, film directors, as well as film theory and criticism. To these core courses are added related courses, particularly those that integrate the study of moving image culture with rhetoric, philosophy, literary criticism, ethnic literature and visual cultures of all types. The program is designed for students who wish to ultimately work in academic film studies, and also for students who wish to understand film better as an art form, as popular culture, and as a major medium of communication.</p>
