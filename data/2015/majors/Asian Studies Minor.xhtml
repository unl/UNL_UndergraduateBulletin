<p class="basic-text">A minor in Asian studies complements a liberal arts education by providing knowledge about the cultures and other aspects of a major part of the world. A minor also provides the basic background for additional studies of Asia in graduate school. Courses that may apply to the minor are offered by a variety of departments (see the following list), but several classes are not scheduled each semester.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Education Abroad.</span> The University of Nebraska–Lincoln cooperates with Nanzan University in Nagoya, Japan, in sponsoring an academic exchange program that allows UNL students to pay University of Nebraska–Lincoln tuition, fees, and housing costs here and then earn transfer credit while studying for a semester or a year in Japan. UNL also cooperates with Senshu University in Tokyo, Japan and Sapporo University in Sapporo, Japan. UNL students are able to pay UNL tuition and fees here and then earn transfer credit while studying for a semester in Japan. In China, UNL has exchange programs with Peking University, China’s premier university and located in the national capital; Xi’an Jiaotong University, a leading school in northwestern China; and Chinese University of Hong Kong. Additional opportunities are available in Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Interested students should contact the Education Abroad Office for more information and application procedures.</p>
