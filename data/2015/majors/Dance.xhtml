<p class="basic-text">The dance major is designed to provide a comprehensive arts experience with emphasis on dance. It is appropriate for students who wish to develop performance and technique skills in dance, who are interested in dance as a fine art, and who wish to prepare to choreograph and teach dance. This program teaches the cultural, theatrical and performing aspects of dance, preparing dancers to participate in dance program concerts and department productions as well as community projects including collaborative works with professional artists. Students have opportunities to take professional master classes and to work with national and international guest choreographers.</p>
