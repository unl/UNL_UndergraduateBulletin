{"creq-id":"178","major":"Software Engineering","concentrations":{"Software Engineering":{"1":"Apply rigorous software engineering practices and principles to the design, development and maintenance of complex software systems in order to produce software in a systematic, controlled and efficient manner for a wide range of applications and contexts. Studies include mathematical foundations, software development, application of theory, experimentation, and software engineering processes, technologies and tools.","2":"Contribute their expertise to the solution of problems by effectively collaborating and communicating with other stakeholders in multidisciplinary teams. Studies include natural sciences, software development, written and oral communications, teamwork, and software engineering technologies and practices.","3":"Quickly adapt to new work environments, assimilate new information, and solve new problems. Studies develop skills in the application of theory, experimentation, software engineering technologies and practices, and technical communications.","4":"Develop a background and perspective for post-graduate education. Studies develop skills in the application of theory, experimentation, and life-long learning\/professional development.","5":"Work in conformance with societal needs and expectations. Studies include liberal arts and ethical\/social issues.","6":"Understand the world of practicing professionals for collaborations, mutual support, and representing the profession to government and society. Studies include teamwork and life-long learning\/professional development, and students are provided multiple opportunities for involvement in undergraduate research, service to the department and community, and in organizations such as ACM, UPE, and IEEE.","7":"","8":"","9":"","10":"","11":"","12":"","notes":""}}}
