<p class="content-box-m-p">ADMISSION</p>
<p class="title-1">College Admission</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students accepted by the University must have an ACT of 20 or SAT of 950, or rank in the upper half of their high school graduating class, and have the following high school preparation to be eligible for guaranteed admission to the College of Education and Human Sciences:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four years of English that include intensive reading and writing experience;</li>
<li>Two years of one foreign language;</li>
<li>Four years of mathematics, that include Algebra I, II, geometry and one year that builds on a knowledge of algebra;</li>
<li>Three years of natural sciences that include at least two years selected from biology, physics, chemistry, and earth science and one year of laboratory instruction;</li>
<li>Three years of social studies, to include at least one year of American and/or world history and one year of history, American government, and/or geography.</li>
</ul>
<p class="title-2">Transfer and Readmitted Students</p>
<p class="basic-text">Transfer students from universities or colleges outside of UNL and readmitted students seeking admission to the College of Education and Human Sciences must have an accumulated average of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale or above and no high school deficiencies. Students who do not meet these requirements must enroll as deciding students in the Exploratory and Pre-Professional Advising Center or in another college. Once they have completed 12 graded hours at UNL with a minimum 2.0 grade point average, and have removed any high school deficiencies, UNL students may apply for admission to the College.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Transfer and readmitted students must meet the graduation requirements for the College of Education and Human Sciences as stated in the current catalog in effect at the time they enter or reenter the College.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students who left the College on probation, or who were dismissed, may seek readmission to the College after two semesters by applying to the UNL Admissions Office. Readmission is not assured. However, the admissions committee is receptive to giving students a second opportunity to be successful. The committee is interested in knowing what the student has done in the intervening period that would suggest the student will be successful when readmitted. Successfully completing correspondence courses and/or community college courses is an effective way to demonstrate one’s commitment to academic success.</p>
<p class="title-2">Transferring from Other Colleges within UNL</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students transferring to the College of Education and Human Sciences from another University of Nebraska–Lincoln college or from the Exploratory and Pre-Professional Advising Center must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0, be in good academic standing, and meet the freshman entrance requirements that exist at the time of their admission to the College of Education and Human Sciences. <span class="basic-text-bold">Students must fulfill degree requirements that exist at the time of their admission to the college, not at the time they enter UNL.</span></p>
<p class="basic-text">To remain current, College of Education and Human Sciences students must enroll in, and complete, at least one UNL course that will apply toward degree requirements during a 12 month period. Students who readmit following an absence of one year or more must meet all requirements in the Undergraduate Bulletin in effect at the time of readmission and enrollment. Students who transfer to another UNL college and later return to the College of Education and Human Sciences will be considered readmitted students. Students who transfer out of a teacher education program, but who continue their certification program while seeking a degree in another UNL college, are exempt from this policy.</p>
<p class="title-2">International Students</p>
<p class="basic-text">The College of Education and Human Sciences welcomes undergraduate international students. As a part of admission to the College, international students must present a TOEFL score of 550 or higher and TSE score of 230 or higher.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students seeking teacher education and state certification must meet the same requirements as any other undergraduate students, including the CORE examination or other basic skills test approved by the Nebraska Department of Education. Students who have received a degree outside of the United States and are interested in teacher certification are required to have a transcript review completed by an approved agency not directly associated with the University of Nebraska. For more information, please contact the Student Services Center.</p>
<p class="title-1">Removal of Deficiencies</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students admitted to the University with core deficiencies are expected to remove those deficiencies in a timely manner. Students with deficiencies are not eligible for graduation. The courses that students use to clear core deficiencies may also be used to meet ACE requirements or other graduation requirements. The Dean of the College of Education and Human Sciences will make the final decision concerning any problems or questions that may arise in satisfying requirements to remove deficiencies.</p>
<p class="content-box-m-p">ADVISING</p>
<p class="basic-text">College of Education and Human Sciences students are encouraged to meet with their assigned academic advisor prior to registration for any term (fall, spring, and summer session). Every CEHS student is assigned to an advisor. If you do not know the name of your academic advisor, please call the advising center at 402-472-8625 or drop-by 105 Henzlik Hall.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The College of Education and Human Sciences Student Services Center is staffed with professional advisors who assist students with assessing educational goals, planning programs of study, understanding program requirements and knowing policies and procedures. As course selection and registration are critical to the timely completion of their academic goals, students are well advised to seek regular academic counseling from their assigned advisors in the Center to obtain the most up-to-date information regarding current requirements and timely completion of degree programs. The Center is also staffed with professionals to coordinate field placements, student teaching, and teaching certificate application.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Ultimately, students are themselves responsible for fulfilling all the requirements of the curriculum in which they are enrolled. The intellectual mentoring relationship between academic advisor and student is protected by confidentiality and strengthened by listening with understanding to student concerns. A student remains with an advisor for the duration of the educational program unless the student changes his/her program of study.</p>
<p class="content-box-m-p">ACADEMIC PROGRAMS &amp; POLICIES</p>
<p class="title-1">Academic Load</p>
<p class="basic-text">A maximum of 18 credit hours may be taken each semester (up to 4 hours in the Pre-Session; up to 7 in each five-week session; up to 9 in the eight-week session) without special authorization from the Director of Advising. UNL students must be enrolled in 12 hours in a semester to be considered full time. Most first-year students are advised to take no more than 12-15 credit hours in the first semester. This allows new students to make an easier transition from high school to college study. Most students require 2-3 hours of preparation for every hour in class, so a schedule of 12 credit hours is actually equivalent to a 36-48 hour a week job.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Outside work may interfere with academic success. The student who must work should plan to take a lighter load and consider taking some summer sessions or an extra semester or two to complete the work required for a degree.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students should check if restrictions on the number of graded hours each term govern their continued eligibility for medical/auto insurance, scholarships, and/or financial aid.</p>
<p class="title-1">Credit Rules</p>
<p class="title-2">Credit by Exam</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students who believe that previous experience satisfies course requirements may approach the appropriate academic department for possible credit by exam options. Credit is rarely given simply for work experience.</p>
<p class="title-1">Dual Degrees</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students in the College of Education and Human Sciences may earn a bachelor of science degree from the College of Education and Human Sciences and a bachelor of science degree from another UNL college. Students must complete the degree requirements for both colleges and a minimum of 30 credit hours beyond their primary college.</p>
<p class="title-1">Student Recognition</p>
<p class="title-2">Dean’s List</p>
<p class="basic-text">A Dean’s List of Education and Human Sciences and dual matriculated students who meet the stated criteria is published in the fall and spring semesters. To be eligible, students must have a minimum semester grade point average of 3.75 in 12 or more graded semester hours. Exceptions are made for students taking required courses offered only on a Pass/No Pass basis.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Student teachers and practica students who either (1) enter the semester of student teaching with a cumulative GPA of 3.75 or above, or (2) earn a 3.75 GPA during the preceding semester on the basis of 12 or more graded semester hours, will be eligible for the Dean’s List with recommendation from the University supervisor.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Post-baccalaureate students working on certifications are eligible upon request to the Director of Advising, but only undergraduate hours apply.</p>
<p class="title-2">Degrees with Distinction</p>
<p class="basic-text">In recognition of outstanding academic excellence, the College of Education and Human Sciences recommends the bachelors degree With Distinction, With High Distinction and With Highest Distinction. All students graduating with distinction must meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Candidates must have completed at least 60 hours at UNL (Child, Youth and Family Studies students enrolled at UNO) by the time of graduation.</li>
<li>Persons in teaching endorsement programs must satisfactorily complete student teaching; persons in non-endorsement programs must satisfactorily fulfill practica or other internship experiences as required by their programs of study.</li>
<li>Eligibility is based on the cumulative grade point average of all credit hours taken at UNL (UNO) prior to the beginning of the term in which the student receives his or her degree.</li>
</ul>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Highest Distinction.</span> Candidates for the bachelors degree who have successfully completed the program to which they were admitted and achieved a 4.0 cumulative grade point average.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">High Distinction.</span> Candidates for the bachelors degree who have successfully completed the program to which they were admitted and achieved a 3.950 thru 3.999 cumulative grade point average.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Distinction.</span> Candidates for the bachelors degree who have successfully completed the program to which they were admitted and have achieved a 3.850 thru 3.949 cumulative grade point average.</p>
<p class="title-2">Undergraduate Scholarships and Fellowships</p>
<p class="basic-text">In addition to the scholarships awarded by the University, the College of Education and Human Sciences awards a number of scholarships funded by various donors—individuals, organizations and foundations. Criteria for awarding these scholarships vary to meet the wishes of the donors but often include financial need, academic performance, major area of study and class standing.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Scholarships which vary in amount are awarded annually to incoming first time, transfer, and continuing College of Education and Human Sciences students. First-time freshmen need to complete the UNL Application for Admission and the FAFSA. Continuing students should complete, annually, the scholarship application through their MyRED account, and include a resume. Completion of the FAFSA is also recommended.</p>
<p class="title-1">Substitutions and Waivers</p>
<p class="basic-text">In rare cases, there may be a need for students to request a special substitution or waiver to curriculum requirements. Such a request is made only in exceptional and unusual circumstances and cannot serve as an excuse for not following correct degree requirements. Specific instructions and procedures are available from students’ academic advisors in the Student Services Center, 105 Henzlik Hall.</p>
<p class="content-box-m-p">BULLETIN TO USE</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are responsible for following the rules, policies and requirements found in the UNL Undergraduate Bulletin for the academic year in which they were last admitted to a program in the College of Education and Human Sciences. Students must complete all program requirements from a single bulletin year. In consultation with their advisor, a student may choose to move to and follow a subsequent bulletin if it is in their best interest.</p>
<p class="content-box-m-p">COLLEGE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p class="title-1">Grade Rules</p>
<p class="title-2">Minimum Grade Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">Grade requirements vary from major to major. Please see the appropriate major listing or check with your advisor regarding minimum grade requirements.</p>
<p class="title-2">Pass/No Pass Option</p>
<p class="basic-text">CEHS students are allowed to take up to 12 hours of Pass/No Pass (P/N) credit. The college departments vary on P/N policies. Students should check with their advisor to be certain they qualify for the Pass/No Pass option.</p>
<p class="title-2">Grade Appeals</p>
<p class="basic-text">Any student enrolled in a course in the College of Education and Human Sciences who wishes to appeal alleged unfair and prejudicial treatment by a faculty member shall present his/her appeal in writing to the Dean’s Office no later than 30 days after notice of the student’s final course grade has been mailed from campus.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students may use and are encouraged to use the following sequential procedures to appeal the grade. The problem may be solved at any of the levels of the appeal procedure.</p>
<p class="numbered-list">1. Contact the instructor. Frequently the problems can be solved at this point.</p>
<p class="numbered-list">2. Submit a request to the chair of the department.</p>
<p class="numbered-list">3. Take the case to the departmental Grading Appeals Committee. The Committee is contacted by the department chair.</p>
<p class="numbered-list">4. Take the case to the College Appeals, Retention and Certification Committee by contacting the Dean’s Office.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph">The complaint will be forwarded to a committee consisting of faculty and student representatives. After a hearing, the Committee will make a written recommendation regarding the appeal. The Committee’s recommendation is binding on the appealing student and faculty member.</p>
<p class="title-1">Transfer Credit Rules</p>
<p class="title-2">Acceptance of Transfer Grades</p>
<ul>
<li>Grades earned at UNL, UNO, UNK</li>
<li>Grades of D-, D, D+, and C- satisfy requirements in all programs in the College unless specified otherwise. Students who receive a grade of D-, D, D+, C-, however, are encouraged to retake the course.</li>
<li>Grades earned outside the University of Nebraska system</li>
</ul>
<p class="basic-text">The college will accept no more than 9 credit hours of grades less than a C from any program outside the University of Nebraska system. Grades below a C can only be applied to general education requirements and elective classes.</p>
<p class="title-2">Maximum Number of Hours for Transfer</p>
<p class="basic-text">Transfer courses are evaluated by the University and by the College to determine UNL and College course equivalencies. The College determines which courses will be accepted and how they will apply toward degree requirements. Sixty (60) is the maximum number of hours that will be accepted on transfer from a two-year college. Ninety (90) is the maximum number of hours that will be accepted on transfer from accredited four-year colleges and universities.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Courses taken 10 years before admission or readmission to the College will be evaluated by the major department to determine if it is appropriate to accept those courses for transfer credit and for application to degree requirements. Specific courses will be reviewed in keeping with the guidelines specified by each department.</p>
<p class="title-2">Transfer Credit from Technical, Non-Accredited and Foreign Institutions</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students who desire to transfer from these institutions must have each course evaluated by the appropriate departmental representative. All rules stated above in reference to grades and maximum credit hours apply. For additional information and guidance in this process contact the Dean’s Office.</p>
<p class="title-2">Transfer Agreements with UNO and UNK</p>
<p class="basic-text">Transfer agreements between the three institutions within the University System allow for a smooth transition for students interested in taking courses from UNO, UNK, and/or UNL. Although restrictions noted above on grades and maximum transfer hours still apply, there are some exceptions. For purposes of residency, courses from UNO and UNK fulfill these requirements. Students planning to major in a program in the college should read the specific requirements noted with individual programs. Questions about academic transfer should be addressed to the Advising Office.</p>
<p class="title-2">Transfer Agreements with Community Colleges</p>
<p class="basic-text">Articulation agreements and “Transfer with Ease Programs” with Nebraska community colleges indicate how courses and programs will transfer to UNL and the College of Education and Human Sciences. The same guidelines noted above on the acceptance of courses, grades, and hours also apply to these institutions. Students interested in transferring from a community college should consult with their school or the Student Services Center to determine which courses will transfer to fulfill specific College of Education and Human Sciences requirements.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Courses from accredited two-year institutions will generally not be substituted for 400-level human sciences classes in the College. The 300-level courses will be considered on an individual basis by the respective departments in the College of Education and Human Sciences.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Courses taken prior to course articulation agreements will be accepted contingent upon departmental validation of the credit.</p>
<p class="title-1">Residency Rules</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students must earn a minimum of 120 credit hours to earn a degree.</p>
<p class="basic-text">All students are expected to complete at least 30 of their final 36 hours of credit at UNL.</p>
<p class="title-1">Degree Application Process</p>
<p class="title-1">Graduation Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are expected to develop a clear understanding of degree requirements and to plan their course of study with a College advisor. Students requiring clarification of outstanding degree requirements should visit with a College advisor promptly.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students should access their Degree Audit via MyRed at least once each term to review degree requirements and progress toward graduation. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure their Degree Audit accurately reflects their current College and program of study.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students who believe their Degree Audit has errors or omissions should visit with a College advisor promptly. It is important that you resolve these matters as soon as practicable to avoid a delay in graduation.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Each student with MyRED access must submit an online Application for Graduation via MyRED for each degree to be received by:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last Friday in January for May graduation</li>
<li>The last Friday in June for August graduation</li>
<li>The last Friday in September for December graduation</li>
</ul>
<p class="basic-text">Students submitting an electronic Application for Graduation via MyRed will be billed a $25.00 per degree fee on their student account. Those students without MyRED access may apply for graduation in person at the Office of the University Registrar, 107 Canfield Administration Building or by mail. Applications for Graduation submitted in person or by mail must be accompanied by a check or money order in the amount of $25.00 payable to the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Failure to submit a timely Application for Graduation may preclude the awarding of a degree in the intended term.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Your Application for Graduation and required $25.00 fee are good only for the term marked on your application. Neither your application nor your fee, are transferrable to another term. If you submit an Application for Graduation and pay the $25.00 fee for a specified term but do not complete your degree requirements in that term, you will need to reapply to graduate in a future term and incur another $25.00 fee.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Commencement ceremony information will be emailed to all degree applicants approximately one month before graduation. Each student who has applied for graduation must submit an online Commencement Attendance Form via MyRED, which will be available when the informational email is distributed.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Only those students who have applied for graduation, had the application accepted, and fulfilled all degree requirements as of the last day of the academic term may participate in the commencement ceremony for that term. Because the University of Nebraska–Lincoln has a commencement for each term, ceremony participation is allowed only in the term during which the student has properly and timely applied for graduation and fulfilled degree requirements.</p>
