<p class="title-1">Academic Advising</p>
<p class="title-2">Dean’s Office for Undergraduate Programs</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are encouraged to obtain information and advice through the Dean’s Office for Undergraduate Programs, CBA 114.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The staff, which includes both professional staff and peer advisors, are well trained, easily accessible, and can provide academic counseling and answer questions on specific degree requirements, transfer credits, prerequisites, changes in major or college, waivers, procedures or policies, and other available campus services.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Professional Staff:</span> Mark Davis, Jeff Burdic, D’Vee Buss, Megan Friesen, Erin Burnette, Ashley Wegener, Wendy Hunt, Natasha Crawford, Jennifer Mostek, Julie Scroggs</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Career Services:</span> While staff and faculty advisors may assist in career advising, the College works closely with the University’s Career Services Office to provide assistance to CBA students. Students should schedule time each semester to visit with the Career Coaches located in CBA 139.</p>
<p class="title-1">Student Responsibility</p>
<p class="basic-text">The University of Nebraska–Lincoln and the College of Business Administration are committed to providing effective academic advising to students.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Academic advisors are available to assist students in assessing educational goals, planning programs of study, understanding program requirements, and following policies and procedures.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are ultimately responsible for fulfilling all the requirements of the curriculum in which they are enrolled.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are responsible for initiating advising contacts and preparing for advising sessions.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The mentoring relationship between academic advisors and students is confidential and is strengthened by advisors’ listening with understanding to student concerns.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are expected to take responsibility for a successful university experience and effective advising session. For this to occur the student must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participate in New Student Enrollment, priority registration programs, and any other University/College programs designed to enhance the student-life experience.</li>
<li>Review My Degree Audit Report each semester and each time you make a change to your schedule.</li>
<li>Schedule appointments with advisors well in advance of priority registration and at other times as needed. Keep appointments and be punctual, or call to reschedule if necessary.</li>
<li>Read the appropriate sections of the Undergraduate Bulletin.</li>
<li>Identify specific questions to address prior to meeting with an advisor and be prepared to do long-term planning.</li>
<li>Provide honest and accurate information to the advisor regarding any concerns, questions, special needs, deficiencies or barriers that might affect academic success.</li>
<li>Follow academic policies and procedures and meet academic calendar deadlines (e.g. registration, fee payment, degree audit, filing for degree, etc.).</li>
<li>Know and complete program requirements.</li>
<li>Seek assistance from the various student support services provided by the University and College.</li>
<li>Immediately notify the University of any change in postal address, email address, and/or phone number.</li>
</ul>
<p class="content-box-m-p">ACADEMIC PROGRAMS &amp; POLICIES</p>
<p class="title-1">Academic Load</p>
<ul>
<li>A maximum of 19 credit hours may be taken each semester without special permission from the Dean’s Office for Undergraduate Programs. The summer sessions have a maximum load of 15 hours. The three week session limit is 3 hours and each five week session has a 7 hour limit.</li>
<li>A minimum of 12 credit hours must be taken each semester to remain a full time student.</li>
</ul>
<p class="basic-text">To complete the requirements for a degree in eight semesters, a student must earn an average of 15 credit hours each semester. Most students need a minimum of two hours of preparation for every hour in class. A schedule of 15 credit hours is actually equivalent to a 45 hour a week job (15 classroom + 30 preparation).</p>
<p class="basic-text">The student who must work or one who may need additional study time, should plan to take a lighter load and consider taking some summer sessions or an extra semester or two to complete the work required for a degree. In the event that a student’s cumulative grade point average falls below 2.5, a lighter academic load may be required.</p>
<p class="title-1">Course Exclusions and Restrictions</p>
<p class="basic-text">No credit for graduation is allowed for non-college level courses or for courses that deal primarily with the development of skills including the following:</p>

<p class="title-1">Student Recognition</p>
<p class="title-2">Dean’s List/Degrees with Distinction/Scholarships</p>
<p class="title-3">Dean’s List</p>
<p class="basic-text">The College recognizes students for academic achievement during the fall and spring semesters by placement on the College Dean’s List. To qualify for the Dean’s List, students must complete 12 or more credit hours for a grade (excluding hours with P, NP, NR and I marks) during the semester and attain a grade point average of 3.6 or higher. Students who have instructed the University to restrict their personal infomation will not appear on the published list but will be notified that they have received this honor.</p>
<p class="title-3">Degrees with Distinction</p>
<p class="basic-text">In recognition of outstanding academic excellence, the college recommends the bachelors degree <span class="basic-text-ital">With Distinction</span>, <span class="basic-text-ital">With High Distinction</span>, and <span class="basic-text-ital">With Highest Distinction</span>. Students are recommended for this honor by the Scholarship, Honors, and Awards Committee of the College.</p>
<p class="basic-text">To be eligible for consideration students must:</p>
<ul>
<li>complete 45 credit hours for a letter grade (excluding Pass/No Pass marks) at UNL prior to the semester in which they graduate, and</li>
<li>must have completed 60 such credit hours at UNL at the time they graduate.</li>
</ul>
<p class="basic-text">To determine the level of distinction, the Committee uses the cumulative grade point average based on all credit hours taken at UNL prior to the beginning of the term in which the student receives his or her degree. No specific cumulative grade point average is required but the honor is limited to approximately ten percent of the graduating class. This usually means a 3.8 (or higher) GPA. Students will be notified of the distinction, high, or highest distinction designation approximately one month before graduation.</p>
<p class="title-1">International Study/Education Abroad</p>
<p class="title-2">Education Abroad</p>
<p class="basic-text">The College of Business Administration has several outstanding education abroad programs where students may enroll and complete course work for their degree requirements at a foreign institution or at an international site.

<p class="title-1">Senior Check</p>
<p class="basic-text">In the term after which a student has completed 85 hours, Graduation Services (109 Canfield Administration Building) will perform a “senior check.” Students will be sent an email notification with a link to MyDegreeAudit. This will inform students about requirements that need to be completed to receive the degree. This information will also be accessible by students through the MyRED Message Center.</p>
<p class="title-2">Graduation Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are expected to develop a clear understanding of degree requirements and to plan their course of study with a College advisor. Students requiring clarification of outstanding degree requirements should visit with a College advisor promptly.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students should access their Degree Audit via MyRed at least once each term to review degree requirements and progress toward graduation. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure their Degree Audit accurately reflects their current College and program of study.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students who believe their Degree Audit has errors or omissions should visit with a College advisor promptly. It is important that you resolve these matters as soon as practicable to avoid a delay in graduation.</p>
<p>Each student with MyRED access must submit an online Application for Graduation via MyRED for each degree to be received by:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last Friday in January for May graduation</li>
<li>The last Friday in June for August graduation</li>
<li>The last Friday in September for December graduation</li>
</ul>
<p class="basic-text">Students submitting an electronic Application for Graduation via MyRed will be billed a $25.00 per degree fee on their student account. Those students without MyRED access may apply for graduation in person at the Office of the University Registrar, 107 Canfield Administration Building or by mail. Applications for Graduation submitted in person or by mail must be accompanied by a check or money order in the amount of $25.00 payable to the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Failure to submit a timely Application for Graduation may preclude the awarding of a degree in the intended term.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Your Application for Graduation and required $25.00 fee are good only for the term marked on your application. Neither your application nor your fee, are transferrable to another term. If you submit an Application for Graduation and pay the $25.00 fee for a specified term but do not complete your degree requirements in that term, you will need to reapply to graduate in a future term and incur another $25.00 fee.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Commencement ceremony information will be emailed to all degree applicants approximately one month before graduation. Each student who has applied for graduation must submit an online Commencement Attendance Form via MyRED, which will be available when the informational email is distributed.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Only those students who have applied for graduation, had the application accepted, and fulfilled all degree requirements as of the last day of the academic term may participate in the commencement ceremony for that term. Because the University of Nebraska–Lincoln has a commencement for each term, ceremony participation is allowed only in the term during which the student has properly and timely applied for graduation and fulfilled degree requirements.</p>
<p class="title-1">Student Standing/Classification</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Second semester freshmen</span> who have completed MATH 104 (or higher) with a grade of C or better and have a cumulative 2.5 GPA over at least 14 credit hours earned at UNL, may enroll in ACCT 201 (which normally requires sophomore standing). Freshmen are also permitted to enroll in ECON 211 or ECON 212 upon completion of 12 hours of UNL credit.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Sophomore Standing.</span> For admission to sophomore standing, a student must have earned a minimum of 27 semester hours of credit. It is expected that students will have removed any entrance deficiencies by this point in the program and should maintain a 2.5 cumulative GPA to remain on sequence for graduation.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Junior Standing.</span> A student has junior standing after meeting the requirements for sophomore standing and completing 53 semester hours of credit.

<p class="title-1">Substitutions and Waivers</p>
<p class="title-2">Curriculum and/or Policy Appeals</p>
<p class="basic-text">The faculty of the College has established degree requirements and policies and procedures. Any exceptions to the rules (substitutions and/or waivers) are made in response to a written appeal submitted to the faculty through the Undergraduate Committee of the College. This request can be made only in unusual circumstances and cannot serve as an excuse for not following college guidelines. Students should meet with an advisor in CBA 114 to discuss options, specific instructions, and procedures for consideration of an appeal.</p>
<p class="title-2">Grade Appeal</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students who believe they have received an unfair grade may take the following sequential actions to appeal a grade:</p>
<ul>
<li>The student must discuss the situation with the instructor involved.</li>
<li>If no acceptable solution is reached, the student may file a written grade appeal with the Grade Appeal Committee of the specific department or school in the College within the first 20 days of the academic semester following receipt of the course grade. In making his or her appeal, the student must allege that the guarantees contained in Section II, Part B, of <span class="basic-text-ital">The Student in the Academic Community</span>, have been violated. The Committee may be contacted through the department chair or school director.</li>
<li>If either the instructor or the student disagrees with the decision of the Grade Appeal Committee, a written appeal may be filed with the Collegiate Grade Appeals Committee, which may be contacted through the Dean’s Office for Undergraduate Programs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="title-2">Grade Option Appeal/Late Withdrawal Appeal:</p>
<p class="basic-text">Appeals to change the grade option in a course after the deadline, as well as any late withdrawal requests must be made in writing to the College Grading and Examinations Committee. Restrictions, options, and forms for either of these procedures may be obtained from the Dean’s Office for Undergraduate Programs, CBA 114. The College generally expects any appeal request to be made within a reasonable time frame.</p>
<p class="content-box-m-p">ACE REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p class="basic-text">All students must fulfill the Achievement Centered Education (ACE) requirements. Information about the ACE program may be viewed at ace.unl.edu. Students may also use the Bulletin’s course search facility to search for ACE groups. Example: Enter ACE one in the search to generate a list of all possible ACE 1 courses. MyRed may also be used to search for offered ACE classes.</p>
<p class="title-1">ACE Achievement-Centered Education—Ten Courses (normally 30 hours)</p>
<p class="basic-text">This is the university’s innovative, outcomes-focused general education component designed to enhance the undergraduate experience by providing broad exposure to multiple disciplines, complementing the major and helping students develop important reasoning, inquiry, and civic capacities.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph">Important rules to remember when selecting course work to meet this requirement:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are 10 ACE Student Learning Outcomes (SLO) and at least one course, equivalent to 3 credit hours, must be taken for each of the 10 SLO’s.</li>
<li>Up to three ACE Student Learning Outcomes (SLO), 4-10, may be satisfied by work in one subject area;</li>
<li>ACE SLO’s must be satisfied by work in at least three subject areas;</li>
<li>No ACE course may satisfy more than one ACE SLO in a student’s program;</li>
<li>If an ACE course addresses two ACE SLO’s, the student decides which one of the two outcomes the course will satisfy in that student’s program. (My Degree Audit will make an automatic decision based on first course taken; first SLO needed.)</li>
<li>As part of the college requirements of non-business and business courses, many courses will also work for ACE. Students should carefully review required course work with ACE options to make the best use of courses to fulfill both degree requirements as well as UNL ACE requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p class="content-box-m-p">BULLETIN TO USE</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students (including transfer students) must follow the Undergraduate Bulletin in effect when they <span class="basic-text-bold">enroll</span> in the College of Business Administration. Students who leave the college and return or those applying for ‘readmission’ to the College are subject to requirements in place at the time of their <span class="basic-text-bold">re-enrollment</span> in the College.</p>
<p class="content-box-m-p">COLLEGE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p class="title-1">Professional Enhancement Program (PrEP) (4 hours)</p>
<p class="basic-text">Designed to develop professional, confident and polished students for lifelong career success, the PrEP program consists of four required one hour courses. These courses are labeled BSAD 111, BSAD 222, BSAD 333, BSAD 444 and are offered across the four year curriculum. Raikes students complete this requirement as a part of their other courses.</p>
<p class="title-1">College General Education Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">The curriculum requirements for the College consist of course work in three areas.</p>
<p class="basic-text">All course work (except electives and where otherwise noted) must be taken for a grade.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The three areas include the following:</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-1">Non-Business Requirements (NBR)</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-2">– Which consist primarily of College and University ACE (Achievement-Centered Education) course work</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-1">Business Core</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-2">– Foundation (BCF), which also includes ACE 6 &amp; 8.</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-2">– Intermediate (BCI)</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-2">– Advanced-Major (BCA-M)</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-2">– Advanced-Capstone (BCA-C), (ACE 10)</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-1">Electives</p>
<p class="title-1">Non-Business Requirements (NBR)</p>
<p class="basic-text-no-indent"><span class="basic-text-bold">(Most of the ACE requirements)</span></p>
<p><span class="header-paragraph-title">Eight Courses (normally 24-26 hours)</span></p>
<p><span class="basic-text">All students in the College of Business Administration will take the following non-business courses (unless otherwise noted).</span></p>
<ul>
<li>While NBR 1, 2, 7 and 8 identify specific ACE options to choose from or identify an ACE course specifically required for the College, NBR 3, 4, 5, and 6 allow students to select courses according to their personal interests (and meet ACE 4, 5, 7, and 9).</li>
<li>Most students will take course work to fulfill these requirements during the freshman/sophomore year. However, if hours are still needed during the junior/senior year, there may also be options to ‘double count’ course work for NBR 3 (ACE 4) and/or NBR 6 (ACE 9) toward the major (BCA-M) or a minor. This is likely to be of most benefit to ‘transfer-in students’ due to the nature of the program and when ACE requirements are traditionally taken.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="basic-text">All course work for NBR must be taken for a grade.</span></p>
<p class="title-2">NBR 1: Written Communication (ACE 1)</p>
<p class="basic-text-no-indent"><span class="basic-text-ital">Choose ONE of the following:</span></p>
<p class="requirement-sec-2">ENGL 150 Writing: Rhetoric as Inquiry</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-2">ENGL 151 Writing: Rhetoric as Argument</p>
<p class="header-paragraph">Students should refer to the course descriptions to select the <span class="basic-text-bold">one</span> course best suited to individual interests. While several communication courses can be selected to fulfill the university ACE 1 outcome, <span class="basic-text-bold">one</span> of the above is a specific requirement for the College of Business Administration and will fulfill both requirements with one course.</p>

<p class="header-paragraph">Notes regarding the selection of course work for NBR 2 (ACE 3):</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="basic-text-bold">Credit cannot be given for both MATH 104 and MATH 106.</span> Students must determine the appropriate course early in their program.</li>
<li>A first semester student’s score on the Math Placement Exam will determine eligibility for MATH 104 or 106. The student should select between these classes based on the following sets of circumstances.</li>
<li><span class="basic-text-bold">Actuarial Science</span> majors <span class="basic-text-bold">MUST</span> take <span class="basic-text-bold">MATH 106 </span>(or a higher-level calculus).</li>
<li>Actuarial science majors will also take MATH 107 (4 cr) and MATH 208 (4 cr) and CSCE 101 &amp; CSCE 101L (4 cr).</li>
<li>RAIKES students MUST take MATH 106 (or a higher-level calculus)</li>
<li>MATH 106 (or higher calculus) is <span class="basic-text-ital">strongly encouraged for those students considering graduate school, accounting majors and finance majors.</span></li>
<li>While several courses can be selected to fulfill the university ACE 3 outcome, one of the above is a specific requirement for the College of Business Administration and will fulfill both requirements with one course.</li>
<li>Freshman students who place below Math 104 on the Math Placement Exam may want to consider summer school in order to maintain their sequence of courses.</li>
</ul>
<p class="title-3">Math Placement Exam (MPE)</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students admitted to the College of Business Administration are required to take a Math Placement Examination prior to enrolling in the college math requirement of MATH 104 or MATH 106 (or higher math).</p>
<ul>
<li>The results of this examination determine which math course students will enroll in their first semester on campus.</li>
<li>The Math Placement Exam may be retaken if a student feels that they can test into a higher level course.</li>
<li>Students lacking sufficient high school preparation in math may need to enroll in equivalent high school preparatory courses, as will be determined by the MPE.</li>
<li>Preparatory courses should be taken as soon as possible to avoid future sequencing problems.</li>
<li>Additional information about the exam can be found at www.math.unl.edu.</li>
</ul>
<p class="basic-text">Whether required to enroll in preparation course work first, as indicated on the MPE (MATH 100A, MATH 101 and/or MATH 103), or in one of the required courses, it is critical to begin MATH the first semester on campus.</p>

<p class="basic-text-no-indent"><span class="basic-text-ital">Choose one course from ACE 9 Certified Courses.</span></p>
<p class="basic-text">Students enrolling for their first semester with junior standing (or more), will see that the list of approved courses includes a few business courses. While this section is labeled “non-business requirements,” students may elect to enroll in one of the business courses to fulfill the ACE 9 requirement as long as prerequisites are completed (which are generally reserved for juniors or seniors). Work closely with your advisor to bring this to their attention and to question how this course may potentially satisfy other degree program requirements, including the major. The options include:</p>
<ul>
<li>ACTS majors – must complete an International Business Course as part of the degree requirements. Actuarial science majors may choose to take ECON 321 International Economics to fulfill the IBCR as well as the global awareness requirement (NBR 6–ACE 9).</li>
<li>ABUS majors – AECN 346, AECN 367, AECN 420, AECN 425, AGRI 282, ENSC 110, HORT 200, may be taken to fulfill the global awareness requirement (NBR 6–ACE 9) as well as a requirement for the major.</li>
<li>BSAD majors – ECON 321, MNGT 414 may be taken to fulfill the global awareness requirement (NBR 6–ACE 9) as well as a requirement for the major. (ECON 321 and MNGT 414 are also IBCR course options).</li>
<li>ECON majors – ECON 321 may be taken to fulfill the global awareness requirement (NBR 6–ACE 9) as well as a requirement for the major. (ECON 321 is also an IBCR option).</li>
<li>IBUS majors – ECON 321 or MNGT 414 may be taken to fulfill the global awareness requirement (NBR 6–ACE 9) as well as a requirement for the major. (Both are also IBCR options).</li>
<li>MNGT majors – MNGT 365, MNGT 414 may be taken to fulfill the global awareness requirement (NBR 6–ACE 9) and may be able to fulfill a requirement for the major/minor depending on the option selected. (MNGT 414 is also an IBCR option).</li>
<li>An alternative to the above options is allowance of the course to count for NBR 6–ACE 9 and the associated minor—but only one or the other (major OR minor).</li>
</ul>
<p class="header-paragraph">In any of the above instances where a double counting is an option, only 3 hours of credit are awarded; student will still need to meet the 120 hours for graduation. Any course that is used for both an ACE requirement and a first major requirement is not allowed to be used towards the completion of the 300/400 Upper Level Requirement.</p>
<p class="title-2">NBR 7: Business Communication (ACE 1)</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-1">BSAD 220 Business Writing</p>

<li>Some hours may need to be additional business course work (to meet the requirement that 60 hours of course work be in business). This requirement will vary by major.</li>
<li>There may be a need to enroll in an international business course requirement (IBCR) if not taken as part of the major or for the business elective(s) requirement.</li>
<li>A minimum of 12 hours of 300/400 upper-level course work beyond the business core is required for most majors to ensure depth is achieved through enrollment in elective hours. See 300/400-level Elective Requirement below for additional information.</li>
</ul>
<p class="header-paragraph">In addition to the Foundation, Leadership, and Computer Science Foundation courses listed earlier, RAIKES students will also complete the following courses as part of the degree requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raikes Design Studio Courses <span class="basic-text-ital">(must be taken for a grade)</span>: RAIK 301H, RAIK 302H, RAIK 401H, RAIK 402H (ACE 10)</li>

</ul>
<p class="header-paragraph">If not completed through the other area requirements, any remaining ACE requirements will need to be completed as required electives.</p>
<ul>
<li>In a 21-hour major, students will average 32 hours of elective credit; 2nd major options and/or minors may be appropriate to consider for elective hours.</li>
</ul>
<p class="title-1">Other Requirements</p>
<p class="title-2">International Business Course Requirement (IBCR)</p>
<ul>
<li>The international business course requirement (IBCR) is to broaden the student’s international perspective.</li>
<li>Each student, excluding accounting majors, must include one course which emphasizes an international perspective.</li>
<li>Actuarial Science majors are encouraged to take FINA 450 if they have not met this requirement with completion of NBR 6 – ACE 9 with ECON 321 or MNGT 414.</li>
<li>The IBCR must be taken for a grade.</li>
</ul>
<p class="header-paragraph">The course must be chosen from the following approved list of International Business Course Requirement (IBCR) courses. Many of these courses have prerequisites. Some are restricted for education abroad and others may only be offered once a year. Thus, you are advised to plan ahead in scheduling this requirement into your program.</p>
<p class="title-3">IBCR Courses</p>
<p class="list">BSAD 491 International Studies in Business and Economics (1-15 hrs)</p>
<ul>
<li>Available only to students studying abroad for which there is no UNL equivalent course.</li>
<li>Available also for the Senshu, Japan, CIMBA Italy, and for the China Education Abroad Programs.</li>
<li>Senshu program students may apply 3 hours towards electives in the FINA, MNGT, or MRKT major; 6 hours applicable for BSAD or IBUS major/minor.</li>
<li>BSAD 491 credit from any other study abroad program should be based on course topics directly associated with a specific major in MNGT, MRKT or FINA, and may need department consent. Students should visit with an academic advisor for assistance.</li>
</ul>

<p class="header-paragraph">If planned carefully, the IBCR course can count in two places. It is not an extra 3 hours of credit, but rather, is 3 hours embedded within other requirements. If selected carefully, it can also count for 3 hours of credit in the major (i.e. MRKT 453 counts for MRKT elective in MRKT major and would count for the IBCR; FINA 450 counts for FINA elective in FINA major and would fulfill the IBCR as well; etc.). On the other hand, if course work for the major is already determined by personal choices, the IBCR can count in electives, and more specifically, for one of the ‘business’ electives needed for most majors. If not planned carefully this requirement can mean that the student will need to take an additional three hours of credit.</p>
<p class="title-2">300/400 Upper-level Requirement</p>
<p class="basic-text-no-indent">As part of the degree requirements, all students must complete a certain number of 300/400 level courses. Most of these courses will be completed in the Business Core but some majors will require additional hours from outside of the Business Core. With a "standard" 21 hour major 12 additional hours will be required.</p>
<p class="basic-text">This can be business or non-business course work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Business course work from the Business Core Intermediate (BCI), Business Core Advanced-Major (FIRST Major) or Business Core Advanced-Capstone may NOT be used to fulfill this requirement with exceptions noted below:</li>
<li>If more than 21 hours of course work for the major are taken at the 300/400-level and of those hours, course work is not being double counted toward the NBR and major, the additional 300/400-level hours can be used to fulfill the 300/400-level requirement. You will need to consult your Degree Audit to determine your requirements.</li>
<li>BSAD majors will complete a 24 hour major and only need to complete 9 upper level hours.</li>
<li>FINA majors, will take between 24 and 27 hours for their major; consult the major section in this document or your Degree Audit to determine how many hours will double count for this requirement. This will depend on which option you select for the major.</li>
<li>Actuarial science, agribusiness majors, international business majors and RAIKES students do not need to meet this requirement due to the additional hours at the 300/400 level required for the major/program.</li>
<li>Business Core Advanced-Major course work used for a SECOND major (if picked), or upper level graded course work selected for a minor MAY count.</li>
<li>Non-business course work (NBR) taken at the 300/400 level may be double counted to fulfill this requirement if it is not being used to double count for the 1st major.</li>
<li>No course may be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis unless it is business course numbered 398/399 credit. Only 3 hours of 398/399 is allowed for this requirement.</li>
</ul>
<p class="title-2">Business Course/Business Elective Hours</p>
<p class="basic-text">At a minimum, sixty (60) hours of business courses are required for the BSBA degree.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The required hours WILL VARY BY MAJOR, dependent on how requirements have been accepted and/or completed throughout the previous components of the program. While <span class="basic-text-bold">GENERAL MINIMUM</span> guidelines by major are noted below, My Degree Audit will specify <span class="basic-text-ital">minimum business</span> credit hour expectations for each student. You will generally see this addressed under the ELECTIVE section (BUSINESS ELECTIVES) on My Degree Audit.</p>
<ul>
<li>ACCT, ECON, MRKT majors – 3 hours of business electives</li>
<li>BSAD – no additional business course work as your major consists of 24 hours of business course work</li>
<li>ACTS – no additional business course work as your major consists of 28 hours of business course work</li>
<li>FINA – no additional business course work as your major consists of 24-27 hours of business course work. UNLESS you select AECN 495A under the Banking and Financial Institutions options, and then you will need 3 hours of business electives.</li>
<li>ABUS and RAIK – no additional business course work required due to intent of major as being ‘business-related’ course work.</li>
<li>Additional hours may be required if there is a variation in hours for NBR, BCF, BCI or BCA, or if there is a violation of the 75% rule, the 15 hour rule, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p class="header-paragraph">Course work must be taken for a grade except for 398/399 options where grades are generally not permitted</p>
<p class="title-1">Foreign Languages/Language Requirement</p>
<p class="basic-text">Other than meeting the minimum requirement for admission to the University, the College does not require any additional work in foreign languages. Students, however, are always encouraged to take language courses.</p>
<p class="title-1">Minimum Hours Required for Graduation</p>
<p class="basic-text">A minimum of 120 semester hours of credit is required for graduation; more may be necessary if specific degree requirements have not yet been completed. Most students will graduate with 121 hours as BSAD 150 is not applicable toward degree requirements.</p>
<p class="title-1">Grade Rules</p>
<p class="title-2">C- and D Grades</p>
<p class="basic-text">While students may earn grades of C- or D, there are restrictions and recommendations for such grades and further enrollment options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grade of C or higher is expected in prerequisite course to enroll in accounting courses</li>
<li>A grade of C or higher is required in FINA 361 in order to take most upper level FINA courses</li>
<li>Grade of C or higher required in other departmental higher-level sequencing courses (i.e. MATH 101 to take MATH 104, etc.). See course descriptions to determine enrollment restrictions.</li>
<li>Minimum 2.5 cumulative GPA required to enroll in many business courses, ACCT 201, ACCT 202, ECON 215, FINA 361, BLAW 371, BLAW 372, MNGT 331, MNGT 350/SCMS 350, MNGT 301, MNGT 475, MRKT 341, MRKT 350.</li>
<li>Grades of C- or lower can be removed by retaking the course at UNL or within the University system (UNK, UNO).</li>
<li>Grades of C or better are required to transfer courses from other institutions.</li>
<li>Academic bankruptcy options may be considered for students who have one or two semesters of poor performance.</li>
</ul>
<p class="title-2">Pass/No Pass Limits</p>
<p class="basic-text">The Pass/No Pass option is designed for students who want to study areas or topics in which they may have minimum preparation. If used for this purpose, the option can enrich the student’s academic experience without lowering the student’s grade point average. Several restrictions apply when considering the Pass/No Pass option:</p>
<ul>
<li>BSAD 111, BSAD 222, BSAD 333, BSAD 444 and BSAD 150 are offered only as Pass/No Pass. All are required and BSAD 150 does not count toward the 120 hours required for the degree</li>
<li>Students may apply no more than 6 hours of elective credit using the Pass/No Pass option (excludes BSAD 111, BSAD 150, BSAD 222, BSAD 333, BSAD 444).</li>
<li><span class="basic-text-bold">No</span> student in <span class="basic-text-bold">any</span> College enrolled at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln may take business courses in the College of Business Administration using the Pass/No Pass option.</li>
<li>College of Business Administration students may <span class="basic-text-bold">NOT</span> take course work to satisfy ACE requirements, the International Business Course Requirement (IBCR), nor <span class="basic-text-bold">any</span> required business course work, including the major and minor, using the Pass/No Pass option.</li>
<li>Students majoring in actuarial science through the College of Business Administration may <span class="basic-text-bold">NOT</span> take any math, actuarial science, or required courses using the Pass/No Pass option.</li>
<li>Students taking courses to fulfill the requirements of a minor in an area of study outside the College of Business Administration are subject to CBA rules restricting use of the Pass/No Pass option if courses in their minor are used to meet ACE or any college-specific requirements.</li>
<li>Students seeking any minor outside the College should verify rules applying to minimum grade expectations and Pass/No Pass options with the advisor for their minor as additional restrictions may apply and they often vary.</li>
<li>Students from UNO/UNK/UNMC and from other institutions are subject to the same restrictions listed here for UNL students.</li>
</ul>
<p class="header-paragraph">Exceptions to the above rules are limited to the following and no other exceptions will be made.</p>
<ul>
<li>An independent study course (398, 399) may be taken in the College of Business Administration using the Pass/No Pass option with the permission of the instructor and the department chair but College of Business Administration students who qualify for this exception may use the independent study course (398, 399) <span class="basic-text-bold">only</span> as elective credit.</li>
<li>Advanced Placement grades of P and Credit By Exam grades of P will be accepted to fulfill degree requirements (with the exception of BSAD 150). These hours will not count against the 6-hour-maximum hours permitted.</li>
<li>Students who travel abroad and return with “credit” rather than grades from the institution where they studied may use P grades to fulfill degree requirements. These hours will not count against the 6-hour-maximum number of hours permitted.</li>
</ul>
<p class="title-2">GPA Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">A 2.5 cumulative grade point average is required to apply for graduation, as well as a requirement for enrollment in ACCT 201 and ACCT 202, ECON 215, BLAW 371 and BLAW 372, FINA 361, SCMS 331, MNGT 301, MNGT 475, SCMS 350 or MRKT 350, and MRKT 341. In some instances, a specific grade is required in certain courses to continue with upper-level course work.</p>
<p class="title-1">Transfer Credit Rules</p>
<p class="basic-text">See Maximum/Minimum hour restrictions under Course Exclusions and Restrictions</p>
<p class="title-1">Course Level Requirements (Hour Requirement 300+)</p>
<p class="basic-text">In addition to the Business Core Intermediate and Business Core Advanced and Business Course Advanced Capstone requirements, business students must complete an additional 12 hours of 300/400-level course work in their program (not required for ACTS, IBUS, SCMS majors and RAIKES students). Students generally fulfill this requirement through their electives, but there may be a few upper-class students who can fulfill the requirement with the ACE course requirements. Twelve hours is based on a 21 hour major. The number is adjusted when there are larger majors.</p>
<p class="title-1">Residency</p>
<p class="basic-text">At least 30 of the last 36 hours of credit must be registered for and completed in residence at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students electing to study abroad in their final semester are exempted for the hours earned abroad, but no additional hours may be transferred in the last 36 hours. This exemption requires filing a written appeal in the Undergraduate Programs office.</p>

<p class="title-2">Dual Degrees</p>
<p class="basic-text">Given the number of elective hours available to most CBA students, consideration should be given to the opportunity to pursue a dual degree, which allows simultaneous enrollment in CBA and another college on campus. Students will need to consult with both colleges to ensure all requirements are satisfied in a timely, efficient manner and that double counting of course (where appropriate) is identified in advance of enrollment. CBA Students involved in Dual degrees must complete a minimum of 150 hours in order to complete the two degrees.</p>
<p class="content-box-m-p">MINORS &amp; AREAS OF SPECIALIZATIONS OFFERED</p>
<p class="title-1">Minors Outside the College</p>
<p class="basic-text">The faculty of the College encourages students to minor in a discipline outside the College to develop logical and critical thinking, curiosity, understanding of the external environment and sensitivity to ethical issues. By developing these abilities, students can enrich their lives and provide a broader basis for informed and responsible decision making.</p>
<ul>
<li>Minors are not required; only recommended.</li>
<li>Course work for the minor may be counted for the minor and ACE if so designated as ACE.</li>

</ul>
<p class="title-1">As CBA students select minors from outside of the College of Business Administration they have two restrictions. CBA requires that a minor which includes courses from CBA must have at least 12 hours of non-business courses. Students must also meet any restrictions accessing the minor. Some colleges restrict their minors to students who have a major within that college.</p>
<p class="title-1">Minors Within the College</p>
<p class="basic-text-no-indent">The College of Business Administration offers the following business minors to business students only.</p>

<p class="title-1">Sales Certificate</p>
<p class="basic-text">The ability to sell is a universal skillset and there is some form of selling involved in almost every job. Students who are interested in developing their sales skills and potentially pursuing a career in sales can get a certificate or advanced certificate in sales through the Center for Sales Excellence in the College of Business Administration (CBA). The sales certificate program is open to all UNL undergraduates – students do not have to be CBA majors/minors to be a part of this program.</p>
<p class="basic-text">To pursue the certificate or advanced certificate, all students must first take MRKT 257 Sales Communication (3 cr). This prerequisite class introduces students to the fundamentals of the sales communication process. MRKT 257 also meets the ACE 2 communication requirement. Following this class, interested students can apply for admission into the sales certificate program. Selected students will need to take the following courses to obtain a Certificate in Sales Excellence:</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-2">MRKT 357 Advanced Professional Selling (3 cr)</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-2">MRKT 371 Sales Practicum I (1 cr)</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-2">MRKT 457 Customer Relationship Management (3 cr)</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-2">MRKT 458 Sales Force Management (3 cr)</p>
<p class="header-paragraph-title">After taking these courses, students interested in earning an Advanced Certificate in Sales Excellence must take the following additional course:</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-2">MRKT 460 Key Account Selling (3 cr)</p>
<p class="header-paragraph">The certificate and advanced certificate will be awarded by CBA. Both complement the student’s existing major/minor and serve as a formal recognition that the student has satisfactorily completed the aforementioned course requirements. Certificates will not be listed on the student’s transcripts. However, given the value of the certificates’ curricula to prospective employers, students will benefit by mentioning these certificates on their resume.</p>
