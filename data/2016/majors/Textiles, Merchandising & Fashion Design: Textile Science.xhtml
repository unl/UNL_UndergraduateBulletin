There may be required courses within an education endorsement program that will also satisfy ACE requirements. Therefore, it is highly recommended that students contact their advisor prior to registering for ACE classes in order to insure that each of the class selections are in the best interest of the students’ academic program.</p>
<p class="title-1">Minor Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students may receive a minor in Chemistry (27 hrs), Hospitality, Restaurant and Tourism Management (19 hrs) or a Business minor (18 hrs). Minors may also be taken in Global Studies or in Women’s and Gender Studies. The student should see their advisor for more information.</p>
