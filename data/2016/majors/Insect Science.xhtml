<p class="basic-text">The field of insect science encompasses the agricultural, biological, and environmental sciences related to insects and their interactions with humans. Insects and their relatives are the most abundant animals on earth, are commonly found in all habitats, and are essential in maintaining our ecosystem. Insect Science offers numerous career opportunities in both basic and applied fields.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The core curriculum provides students with a balanced education focusing on insect identification, biology, structure and function, behavior, ecology, and diversity, as well as courses in mathematics, science, and the humanities. In addition to the core, there are two options from which students can select an area of focus which meets their own interest and career objectives.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p class="title-1">Core Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">The following basic courses are required for majors in insect science. In addition, students must select and meet the requirements of one of the options, depending on their own individual interests and career objectives.</p>
