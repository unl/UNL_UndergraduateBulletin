In order to provide students with flexibility, there are two ways to obtain the minor. The first (Plan A) requires taking one course from each of five domains that span educational psychology plus one additional course in a domain of the student's choosing. The second (Plan B) requires taking one course from each of three domains of the student's choosing plus additional concentrated course work in a particular domain, research under the supervision of a faculty member, or field experience.</p>
