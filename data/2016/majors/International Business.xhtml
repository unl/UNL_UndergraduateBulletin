<p class="content-box-h-1">DESCRIPTION</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students in international business (IB) study the business practices of other nations and learn how international trade laws affect the world economy. A background in international business will help students become a better member of the management team of any corporation. From banks to manufacturing firms, an increasing number of industries need professionals who understand the world’s business environment. Import and export firms, agricultural commodities firms, and government and non-government agencies may specifically seek international expertise. It is suggested that students begin thinking about where they want to study abroad and their language and culture courses during the freshman year. Upper-level course work and education abroad experience will be done sometime in the junior or senior year.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Because the nature of the major requires studying abroad and careful selection of course work to complement and count for appropriate requirements, students are strongly encouraged to consult with their advisor or a staff member in the Undergraduate Programs Office.</p>
<p class="basic-text">In order for students to be successful in international business after graduation, they should plan to do the following as part of their university experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Internships related to international business</li>
<li>Involvement with international student groups</li>
<li>Language study</li>
<li>Courses that will provide them with greater awareness and knowledge of global issues</li>
<li>Education abroad experiences</li>
</ul>
<p class="content-box-h-1">ADMISSION</p>
<p class="title-1">Major/Department Admission</p>
<p class="basic-text">Admission requirements for all majors in the College are the same as those for University Admission as noted under UNL General Admission Requirements.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p class="title-1">Core Requirements</p>
<p class="title-2">Business Core Advanced–Major (BCA-M)</p>
<p class="basic-text">In addition to the College Degree Requirements, students will complete 27-35 hours of course work for the major. The broad components of an international business major are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete 15 credit hours of business courses selected from one of the following specialization options:
<ul>
<li>Economics</li>
<li>Management</li>
<li>Finance</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Supply Chain Management</li>
<li>General International Business</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Complete 12 hours of international business courses from the specified list for the selected specialization option.</li>
<li>Fulfill a global immersion requirement by completing a study abroad experience and the equivalent of at least 8 credit hours of foreign language, which may be completed during the study abroad experience. It is possible that the language course work can be counted towards electives or left untranscripted.</li>
<li>Participate in an international internship/practicum experience.</li>
</ul>
<p class="basic-text-no-indent">As noted in the College Degree Requirements section, all course work for the major must be taken for a grade. No course work for this major may be double counted with any other business major or minor.</p>
<p class="title-1">Specific Major Requirements</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">A. Specialization Options:</span> To gain expertise in a functional area of business, IB majors must choose one specialization option, and must complete the required courses for that option. Required courses for each specialization option are shown below.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">B. International Business Courses:</span> IB majors must take at least 12 credit hours from the IB course list associated with the selected specialization Option, including a required 3 credit hour integrated IB course (BSAD 420 Global Leadership &amp; the Culture Map, described below). Up to 6 credits of BSAD 491 may be applied to the International Business Courses requirement. Students with interests in specific regions or countries should consider pursuing a regionally-focused minor (e.g. minor in African Studies or Asian Studies) and/or take BSAD 491 courses that focus in their region of interest (e.g. BSAD 491  Doing Business in China)</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">C. BSAD 420 </span><span class="header-paragraph-title">Global Leadership &amp; the Culture Map</span><span class="header-paragraph-title"> is required for IB majors.</span> This course will connect functional areas to global contexts. The course will cover international management from a strategic perspective with an in-depth focus on cross-cultural dimensions among countries. This course is taught from an international perspective, not taught from the perspective of U.S. enterprises.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">D. IB students are required to complete a global immersion experience comprised of a semester abroad.</span> One semester abroad must be at least 13 weeks. This requirement may be met by two shorter study abroad experiences totaling 13 weeks.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">E. Students must earn the equivalent of a minimum of 8 credit hours of foreign language credit.</span> For many CBA-sponsored study abroad options, foreign language classes will be taught in the host country and the cost of the foreign language courses will be included in the study abroad program costs. Alternately, a student can complete a minimum of 8 credit hours of foreign language at UNL. International students are not allowed to use their native language to meet the foreign language requirement. International students may use English as their foreign language if English is not their native language by taking an equivalent of 8 credit hours of English language beyond their required English language courses. This additional language training must be aimed at improving written and/or spoken English proficiency. As such, the equivalencies may be a combination of credit or non-credit bearing courses, ESL courses, certificate programs, and/or structured conversational courses and programs. Equivalencies will be determined by assigning 1 credit hour to every 15 hours of language training. Training may be undertaken either at UNL or at a different institution, but should be pre-approved by the IB Director whose office will maintain a list of suggested courses and programs.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">F. IB students are required to complete an international internship and/or practicum experience</span>, which may be a paid or non-paid project-based practicum or traditional internship, and must be approved by the IB director. Students may take the initiative in arranging the internship or seek help through the IB program office or the CBA Career Services.</p>

<p class="requirement-sec-1">ACE 7 – Study of Arts</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-3">Take any course that piques your mind, relates to a region of interest, or strengthens your functional area.</p>

<p class="requirement-sec-3">Several business international courses count for ACE 9 credit, or take any course that piques your mind, relates to a region of interest, or strengthens your functional area.</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-4">For example, consider COMM 211 Intercultural Communication to complement a business communication interest; take ETHN 203 Introduction to Africa if you are interested in doing business in Africa, or take MNGT 365 Managing Diversity in Organizations to better understand how to manage a diverse workforce.</p>

<p class="basic-text">Students interested in a minor related to international business should consider a minor in global leadership.</p>
<p class="basic-text">While not required, students should consider a minor in language and/or consider options in other departments related to the country of interest (i.e., history, political science, global studies, Asian studies, ethnic or European studies, Latin American studies, etc.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Refer to Arts and Science minors for options and requirements which may compliment the geographical area and/or language of interest.</li>
<li>Those interested in pursuing a language minor may be able to double count NBR 4–Ace 5. Students will need to compare the requirements for their minor with the ACE course list to determine applicability.</li>
<li>In any of these instances, credit hours count only ONCE; student still needs 120 hours for the degree.</li>
<li>Be sure to distinguish differences between Plan A and Plan B minors (as Plan A requires completion of only ONE minor, while Plan B requires completion of an additional minor).</li>
