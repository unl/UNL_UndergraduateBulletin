<p class="basic-text">Latino and Latin American Studies includes a major and minor in Latin American Studies and a minor in U.S. Latina/Latino Studies.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The major and minor in Latin American Studies are designed to provide a sound basis for undergraduate students who intend to seek employment with governmental agencies and private enterprises with operations in Latin America, as well as those who decide to undertake graduate study in some academic discipline with emphasis in this area. The U.S. Latina/Latino Studies minor focuses on people of Latin American origin or descent living in the U.S.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Many students who major in Latin American Studies carry a double major with Spanish, history, political science, economics, global studies, or international business, or have chosen to minor in one of those fields.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The University of Nebraska–Lincoln and the University of Nebraska at Omaha are cooperating with the Latin American Studies major. UNO students may complete their course requirements by attending classes at UNL. UNL students may take courses offered at UNO to meet some requirements for a major in Latin American Studies. Please note that UNL residency requirements still apply. Students should check with their advisor for information on UNO equivalent courses or other courses that may apply to the Latin American Studies major. Associate Professor Lourdes Gouviea, Director of the Office of Latino and Latin American Studies at UNO, is the UNO campus coordinator for our Latin American Studies Program.</p>
