<p class="basic-text">The minor in entrepreneurship is targeted toward students who might not traditionally interact with the College of Business Administration and the local entrepreneurial community. The goal of the minor is to teach non-CBA students how to create successful businesses based on the expertise developed in their majors. Two tracks will be offered: one for business majors that emphasizes core entrepreneurship courses; the other for non-business majors which covers basic business courses along with the entrepreneurship core. These tracks allow the student to tailor the minor to their needs according to the type of business they plan to pursue.</p>
