<p class="title-1">Minor in Business Analytics</p>
<p class="basic text">There is a national growing demand for business analytics. This minor will supplement a student’s major in business by giving them greater depth in the ability to discover and manipulate data. It will also enhance a student’s ability to interpret and create useful information for business decisions.</p>
<p class="basic text">All course prerequisites will be enforced.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">REQUIREMENTS FOR MINOR OFFERED BY DEPARTMENT</p>
<p><span class="title-3;">The 12 hour minor will include:</span></p>
<p class="requirement-sec-1">A) Required:</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-2">SCMS 335 Supply Chain Decision Making Models (unless an SCMS major*)</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-2">SCMS 451 Introduction to Predictive Analytics—business analytic tools</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-2">SCMS 452 Database Management Systems—big data plus data mining)</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-1">B) One (two if an SCMS student) of the following directed elective courses:</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-2">ACCT 308 Managerial Accounting—cost accounting (unless an ACCT major*)</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-2">ACCT 309 Accounting Systems—information systems in accounting (unless an ACCT major*)</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-2">MRKT 355 Marketing Metrics</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-2">SCMS 437 Supply Chain Risk Management—simulation modeling (unless an SCMS major*)</p>
<p class="basic-text">No students may double count any courses. Thus accounting students cannot count ACCT 308 or ACCT 309 toward the business analytics minor, nor can SCMS students count SCMS 335 or SCMS 437 if it is included in their SCMS major.</p>
