<p class="basic-text">The women's and gender studies (WGS) major is a multidisciplinary academic program with courses that focus on knowledge relating to women, gender, and sexuality.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The program is designed to help students to learn about historical and contemporary contributions of women and to analyze the construction and representation of gender in the arts, literature, history, psychology, education, contemporary culture, politics, and society. Students are challenged to examine critically assumptions about women and gender held by academic disciplines and to evaluate them based on current research and individual experience. Students also explore sex roles, gender systems, and sexuality in various cultures as they change over time.</p>
