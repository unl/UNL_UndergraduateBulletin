<p class="basic-text">The global leadership minor from the College of Business Administration (CBA) prepares students to be able to identify global opportunities to create, expand, or re-energize organizations and initiatives. The Global Issues course exposes students to human conditions and problems related to development, entrepreneurship, environment, population, and poverty. The Leadership in a Global Context course focuses on international management from a U.S. perspective, and Global Leadership and the Culture Map is an experiential course where students learn how to launch an international venture or project while developing cultural competency. The project is interdisciplinary and may draw from education, engineering, science, social science, and humanities and is set in a particular cultural context. In addition to taking all three aforementioned courses, students are required to earn 3 credit hours while studying abroad on a CBA-approved program. The study abroad trip will provide students excellent global immersion experience and first-hand cultural context in a country of their choice. The minor is available to both business and nonbusiness students.</p>
