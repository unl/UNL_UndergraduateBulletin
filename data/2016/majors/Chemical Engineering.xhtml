<p class="header-paragraph-title">Accepts responsibility for life-long learning.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Continues professional growth and development throughout his or her career by participating in professional societies such as AIChE, industrial training, continuing education and professional development courses.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph">The Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering offers a course of study designed for students who plan careers in a wide variety of industries, ranging from the chemical and process industries to biotechnology, electronics, and the environment. Students receive training in the basic subjects of mathematics, English, and physics in common with other students in engineering, but in addition receive extensive training in chemistry. In various courses the emphasis is placed on the fundamental principles of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, mass transfer, separation processes, thermodynamics, kinetics, and process dynamics, as well as process economics and design of chemical processes.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The instructional laboratories provide opportunities for students to operate experimental equipment, to test the theories and correlations developed in the classroom, and to design their own experimental equipment for the solution of special problems.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Graduates are qualified to undertake work in research, design, development, production, maintenance, and technical sales in a wide variety of industries including chemicals, petroleum, petrochemicals, rubber, plastics, agricultural chemicals, food, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, paper, fabrics, aircraft, automotive, electronics, energy conversion, and environmental pollution prevention and control.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering is located in Othmer Hall. A state-of-the-art unit operations laboratory, used to give hands-on chemical process experience, is located there. Laboratory equipment is provided for the study of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, mass transfer, staged operations, process control, thermodynamics, reaction kinetics, and polymerization. The department operates its own microcomputer facility. Additional research equipment is available for independent and graduate study in several areas.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR DEPARTMENT ADMISSION</p>
<p class="basic-text">To earn Professional Admission to the chemical engineering degree program, a student must complete a minimum of 43 credit hours applicable to the chemical engineering degree and complete CHME 202 with a grade of C- or higher. The student must have a cumulative GPA of 2.500 or higher to be professionally admitted. The faculty of the chemical and biomolecular engineering department reviews students for professional admission once they have earned 43 credit hours and completed CHME 202. A student may be reviewed twice for professional admission to chemical engineering. If the student is denied professional admission to chemical engineering twice, then the student will be required to change their major and will not be allowed to complete a chemical engineering degree. After the student is awarded professional admission to chemical engineering, they will be allowed to enroll in the appropriate 300- and 400-level engineering courses.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p class="title-1">Specific Major Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">Any student in the chemical and biomolecular engineering program whose grade point average in required chemical and biomolecular engineering courses is less than 2.4 will be admitted to the required courses of the following year only with the special permission of the department.</p>
