<p class="basic-text">The Department of Biochemistry offers studies leading to either a bachelor of science (BS) or to a combined bachelors and masters degree (BS and MS) in biochemistry. The training offered is suitable for a professional career in biochemistry, which may lead to employment in various industries involved in the manufacture or processing of chemicals, foods, feeds, and pharmaceuticals; or federal agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Public Health Service, and Environmental Protection Agency. The program is also suitable as preparation for graduate studies leading to academic careers in biochemistry and professional careers in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, pharmacy, and health-related fields.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The combined bachelors and masters degree in biochemistry is especially tailored for highly motivated undergraduate students with superior ability who seek additional training to further their career goals. This research thesis-based program is designed to provide opportunities to students to carry out and interpret contemporary research.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Work.</span> Advanced degrees of master of science and doctor of philosophy are available. For details, consult the Graduate Studies Bulletin.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Laboratory Fee and Deposit.</span> Students who enroll in laboratory courses in the Department of Biochemistry may be required to pay a small nonrefundable cash fee to defray the cost of materials consumed in the course and a deposit to cover the cost of replacing or repairing equipment the student may damage in the laboratory.</p>

<p class="header-paragraph">Within the same subject matter area, students may request a more advanced course be substituted for a required course.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate Credit.</span> Students who earned AP or IB credit for general chemistry in high school are still required to complete a freshman-level chemistry sequence at an accredited post-secondary institution. These students are encouraged, but not required, to take CHEM 113/CHEM 114 rather than CHEM 109/CHEM 110. High school dual enrollment credit is not included in this policy.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Program Assessment.</span> In order to assist the department in evaluating the effectiveness of its programs, selected courses are assessed and majors are required to participate in an exit interview in their senior year. The interview will be conducted in the BIOC 435 course and results of participation in the interview will in no way affect a students GPA or graduation.</p>
