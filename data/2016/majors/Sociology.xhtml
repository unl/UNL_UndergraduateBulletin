<p class="basic-text">A major in sociology within the College of Arts and Sciences  is a valuable and flexible program. The sociology curriculum provides students with vital skills, including analytical thinking, creative problem solving, effective written and oral communication, making meaning out of data through analyses, and greater understanding of social and cultural differences among people. Course choices may be made with respect to a students interests and educational objectives. Students may pursue broad training in sociology or may pursue one of our five focus areas. Focus areas include: crime/deviance, family, health, social inequality, and social research. Students are encouraged to complete an internship to apply the perspectives gained in their coursework to the real world and acquire experience in a career path.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Current majors and students considering a major in sociology should consult with a department advisor when registering for classes. This is particularly important because the subjects that lay the foundation for later training in sociology, plus the courses for a minor in another department, should be carefully selected. The advisor can also discuss focus areas, internships, and research opportunities.</p>
<p class="basic-text">This department participates in the programs of Global Studies, Ethnic Studies, Environmental Studies, the Center for Great Plains Studies, the Womens and Gender Studies Program, and the Center for Civic Engagement.</p>
<p class="basic-text">One course in rural sociology, AECN 276, may count toward a major in sociology. Students in the College of Agriculture who have taken AECN 276 may substitute the course for SOCI 101 if they plan to take other courses in the Department of Sociology.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Work.</span> The advanced degrees of master of arts and doctor of philosophy are offered. For details of these programs, see the Graduate Studies Bulletin and the departmental bulletin, Sociology Graduate Program Guidelines, available at 711 Oldfather Hall.</p>
