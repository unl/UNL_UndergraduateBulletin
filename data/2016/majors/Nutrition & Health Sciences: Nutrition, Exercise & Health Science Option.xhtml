<p class="content-box-h-1">DESCRIPTION</p>
<p class="basic-text">The Nutrition, Exercise and Health Science option is designed for those students interested in planning, conducting and managing health-related fitness and wellness programs in a variety of settings. Graduates are prepared to enter a variety of health/fitness/recreation-related positions such as: fitness/wellness programs provided by corporations for their employees; fitness, health assessment, and cardiac rehabilitation programs provided by hospitals or medical clinics; programs provided by YMCA’s, private health clubs and commercial fitness clubs; government or private agencies which provide health or fitness assessment or lifestyle behavior modification programs for employees or other groups of individuals; and community recreation centers and other health, fitness or lifestyle-related endeavors. The nutrition, exercise and health science option provides an appropriate vehicle for premedical, predental, prechiropractic and prephysical therapy majors who may be able to obtain a degree in nutrition and simultaneously meet entrance requirements for a professional program.</p>

<p class="title-1">ACE Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">All UNL students will be required to complete a minimum of 3 hours of approved course work in each of the 10 designated Achievement Centered Education (ACE) student learning outcome areas. These can be viewed at http://ace.unl.edu. Students will be provided a list of classes they can select from to meet each of the 10 ACE Student Learning Outcomes (SLO). There may be required courses within an education endorsement program that will also satisfy ACE requirements. Therefore, it is highly recommended that students contact their advisor prior to registering for ACE classes in order to insure that each of the class selections are in the best interest of the students’ academic program.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">ADDITIONAL MAJOR/ENDORSEMENT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p class="title-1">Grade Rules</p>
<p class="title-2">C- and D Grades</p>
<p class="basic-text">Only grades of C or above will count toward graduation requirements for NUTR courses.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Grade of C or higher is required for BIOS 214.</p>
<p class="title-2">Grades Earned at UNL, UNO, UNK</p>
<p class="basic-text">Grades of D-, D, D+, C- satisfy requirements of the programs in human sciences unless specified otherwise under the Programs and Departments section of the bulletin. Students who receive a grade of D-, D, D+, or C-, however, are encouraged to retake the course, particularly if it is in the major area.</p>
<p class="title-2">Grades Earned Outside UN System</p>
<p class="basic-text">Up to 9 hours of grades below C (C-, D+, D, D-) from other academic institutions can only be applied to general education requirements and elective classes.</p>
<p class="title-2">Pass/No Pass Limits</p>
<p class="basic-text">All courses specified by course and number must be taken for a grade.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The Pass/No Pass (P/N) option is designed for students who want to study elective areas or topics when they may have minimum preparation. If used for this purpose, the option can enrich the student’s academic experience without lowering the student’s grade point average. Free electives may be taken P/N. Students can earn no more than 12 hours of pass credit excluding courses offered on Pass/No Pass only basis. Not all classes can be taken under the Pass/No Pass option. All courses, specified by course and number, must be taken for a grade. Should a student have earned a P in one of the courses prior to starting the option, the P will be reviewed by the appropriate department.</p>
