<p class="basic-text">A degree in agricultural education is designed to prepare students with the necessary communication and interpersonal skills, leadership training, and knowledge of technical agriculture to be a teacher of agricultural education at the secondary or postsecondary level, or accept employment in agribusiness leading to positions in training and/or development. The degree provides good preparation for work in agricultural extension, positions in foreign service, and agricultural educators in business and industry. Many students graduate with a dual degree in agricultural education and another degree in the College. Agricultural education students may elect to follow the teaching options or the leadership option.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR DEPARTMENT ADMISSION</p>
<p class="basic-text">Student admission to the teacher education program in the Department of Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication requires successful completion of ALEC 494 at least six months prior to student teaching.  Student teaching is conducted off campus through university-approved agreements with cooperating secondary schools. Plans for student teaching must be made early.</p>
<p class="basic-text">To be admitted into the student teaching program candidates must have: 1) a minimum scholastic grade point average of 2.75 including no grades lower than “C” within the endorsement area, and no grades lower than “C+” within professional education courses; 2) passing scores within PRAXIS I SERIES - Core Academic Skills (reading, writing, and mathematics); 3) 1,000 hours of verified work experience within their intended teaching endorsement area, or 300 hours of supervised employment  under the direction of a UNL academic unit. Student Teaching (ALEC 431) is available as Pass/No Pass only. Meet with your advisor to plan for your student teaching experience.</p>
<p class="title-1">Other Admission Requirements</p>
<p class="title-2">Teaching Certificate</p>
<p class="basic-text">Successful completion of the teaching endorsement requirements, including a passing score on the corresponding PRAXIS II SERIES Content Area Test, and recommendation by the Department of Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication, warrants recommendation for a Nebraska Secondary Teaching Certificate by the Nebraska Department of Education. Such certification will include a broad field endorsement to teach either secondary agricultural education or industrial technology (6-12).  The choice is available to students completing an agricultural education endorsement to complete additional course work qualifying for subject endorsement in biology.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students in other agricultural degree programs may qualify based upon meeting endorsement and teaching certificate requirements.</p>
<p class="title-2">Criminal History/Background Check</p>
<p class="basic-text">Effective August 2012, individuals enrolled in any UNL teacher education course requiring a practicum experience in schools or other institutions must have successfully completed a background review prior to any practicum visitations. Two successful reviews will be required during your teacher preparation program; one prior to your initial practicum experience, and a second prior to your student teaching field experience. Background reviews must be completed through One Source, The Background Check Company. See your advisor or practicum course instructor for necessary details to request and complete a background review.</p>
<p class="title-2">Nebraska State Department of Education Policy Pertaining to Students with Felony or Misdemeanor Convictions</p>
<p class="basic-text">The Nebraska Department of Education policy requires that a person with felony convictions or misdemeanor convictions involving abuse, neglect, or sexual misconduct shall not be allowed to participate in pre-student teaching laboratory and classroom experiences or student teach without approval by the Board of Education. To comply with this policy, the Department of Agricultural Education will require each student to affirm under oath that he/she does not have any convictions in the above-named areas prior to each field placement. If a student does have any felony or misdemeanor convictions, he/she is required to meet with Dr. Tom Wandzilak, Certification Officer, Student Services Center, 104 Henzlik Hall, 402-472-8626, as soon as possible. Students with questions pertaining to convictions should contact Dr. Wandzilak.</p>

<p class="title-1">Skilled and Technical Sciences 2+2 Teaching Option</p>
<p class="basic-text">The following is a 2+2 program for students interested in obtaining certification in Skilled and Technical Sciences (STS). This certification will allow an individual to teach Skilled and Technical Sciences in a Nebraska secondary school (grades 6-12). Completion of the 60 credit hour requirement in the Skilled and Technical Sciences 2 + 2 Teaching Option at UNL, along with the completion of an associate of science or an associate of applied science within a post-secondary institution with a 2 + 2 agreement, will allow a student to complete a BS degree in agricultural education from UNL.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The program is an agreement between the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources (CASNR) and community college systems in Nebraska. The 2+2 program requires a student to complete the first two years at a community college and earn an associate of science or an associate of applied science degree before transferring to the University of Nebraska–Lincoln (UNL).</p>
<p class="basic-text">The transfer policy in CASNR will be in effect for all students interested in the STS 2+2 program. This 2+2 program is for the STS teaching program and will be the only program available for students to become certified at UNL. Students transferring into other UNL programs other than the STS program must follow the requirements set forth through the departments within the specific colleges. Students do have the option of taking ALEC 105 Introduction to Engineering Design (IED) and ALEC 115 Principles of Engineering (POE) on campus at UNL. Once completed, these courses can be reverse transferred to satisfy the STEM requirement at the community college. See your STS faculty advisor for details.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The prerequisite for entry into the STS certification program at UNL is the completion of the Skilled and Technical Sciences Program at a community college with a 2 + 2 Skilled and Technical Sciences Agreement. Students who transfer into UNL from other programs within the community college system will not be eligible for entry into the 2+2 program in STS at UNL.</p>
<p class="basic-text">To be admitted into the student teaching program candidates must have: 1) a minimum scholastic grade point average of 2.75 including no grades lower than “C” within the endorsement area, and no grades lower than “C+” within professional education courses; 2) passing scores within the Pre-Professional Skills Test (Core Praxis 1); 3) 1,000 hours of verified work experience within the Skilled and Technical Sciences (STS) career cluster, or 300 hours of supervised employment in the STS career cluster under the direction of a UNL academic unit. Student Teaching (ALEC 431) is available as Pass/No Pass only. Meet with your advisor to plan for your student teaching experience.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Teaching Certificate.</span> Successful completion of the teaching endorsement requirements, along with a recommendation by the Department of Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication, warrants recommendation for a Nebraska Secondary Teaching Certificate by the Department of Education, with an endorsement to teach skilled and technical sciences (6-12).</p>
<p class="title-1">STS Teaching Option</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students who meet entry requirements in the STS Teaching Option will have completed a variety of course work from their community college. Many of the courses within the community college system have direct equivalencies with our ACE program at UNL. Following a comprehensive transfer analysis, students will be provided an accurate degree audit of the remaining ACE courses needed at UNL along with the professional program in Agricultural Education. The minimum requirements of CASNR reflect the common core of courses that apply to students pursuing degrees in the college. Students should work with an advisor to satisfy ACE outcomes 5, 7, 8, and 10 requirements. ACE requirements 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 9 will be completed through their academic programs within the community college system since it is a requirement for an associate of science or an associate of applied science degree at their institutions.</p>
