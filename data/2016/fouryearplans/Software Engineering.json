This results in a total of 124 credit hours required for the Software Engineering major.\r\n\r\nSCIENCE REQUIREMENT (12 hours): Software Engineering students must take at least 12 credit hours of science courses intended for science\/engineering majors and must include at least one laboratory. Course can be selected from the five disciplines of Chemistry, Physics & Astronomy, Biological Sciences, Earth & Atmospheric Sciences, and Anthropology (ANTH 242 & ANTH 242L only). Courses must include at least one lab.\r\n\r\nMATH REQUIREMENT (18 hours): Software Engineering students must take MATH 106, MATH 107, MATH 314, STAT 380, and one of the following: MATH 208, MATH 208H, MATH 238, MATH 428, MATH 439, MATH 465, or an approved Statistics course (choose from STAT 412, STAT 414, STAT 442 or STAT 450)\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL ELECTIVES (15 hours): Software Engineering students must take at least 15 credit hours of SOFT or CSCE technical electives. At least 9 hours must be taken at the 400 level except SOFT and CSCE courses required by the Software Engineering major and except courses that have been designated as courses that will not count toward a major or minor in Computer Science or Software Engineering by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\n     Included courses at the 200-level are: CSCE 236.\r\n\r\n     Included courses at the 300-level are: CSCE 335, CSCE 351 CSCE 396 and CSCE 399H.\r\n\r\n     In addition to the courses mentioned above, excluded CSCE designated courses are: CSCE 401H, CSCE 402H, CSCE 488, CSCE 489, CSCE 490, and CSCE 493. Honors versions of these courses are also not allowed to count towards technical elective credits.\r\n\r\nSoftware Engineering students must must complete an internship for credit prior to graduation (1 credit hour of CSCE 491)."}}}
