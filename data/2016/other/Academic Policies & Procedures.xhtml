<p class="content-box-h-1">CREDIT HOUR DEFINITION</p>
<p class="basic-text">Academic units must follow the federal credit hour definition (please refer to http://policy.ncahlc.org/Federal-Regulation/assignment-of-credits-program-length-and-tuition.html): A credit hour is an amount of work represented in intended learning outcomes and verified by evidence of student achievement that is an institutionally established equivalency that reasonably approximates not less than</p>
<p class="list">1. One hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out of class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester hour of credit, or the equivalent amount of work over a different amount of time; or</p>
<p class="list">2. At least an equivalent amount of work as required in paragraph (1) of this definition for other academic activities as established by the institution including laboratory work, internships, practica, studio work, and other academic work leading to the award of credit hours.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">STUDENTS RESPONSIBILITIES IN ACADEMIC ADVISING</p>
<p class="basic-text">The University of Nebraska–Lincoln is committed to providing effective academic advising to students as an essential component of their educational experience.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Department and college advisers are assigned to students in their programs for assistance in assessing educational goals, planning programs of study, understanding program requirements, and following policies and procedures. Professional academic advisors in the Exploratory and Pre-Professional Advising Center provide these services to students who have not yet declared their undergraduate college or major.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are ultimately responsible for fulfilling all the requirements of the curriculum in which they are enrolled. Students are also responsible for initiating advising contacts and preparing for advising sessions. The mentoring relationship between academic advisors and students is confidential and is strengthened by advisors listening with understanding to student concerns.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are expected to take responsibility for a successful university experience and effective advising session by:</p>
<p class="list">1. Participating in New Student Enrollment and priority registration programs;</p>
<p class="list">2. Scheduling appointments with advisors well in advance of priority registration and at other times as needed;</p>
<p class="list">3. Identifying class choices from requirements of the selected program or major;</p>
<p class="list">4. Identifying questions to address in advising sessions;</p>
<p class="list">5. Informing advisors of any special needs, deficiencies or barriers that might affect academic success;</p>
<p class="list">6. Following academic policies and procedures and meeting academic calendar deadlines (e.g. registration, fee payment, senior check/degree audit, filing for degree, etc.);</p>
<p class="list">7. Knowing and completing degree or program requirements;</p>
<p class="list">8. Monitoring their progress toward meeting degree requirements by maintaining a copy of their academic records and seeking assistance to resolve any errors or questions; and</p>
<p class="list">9. Acting on recommendations to seek assistance from the various student support services provided by the University.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">MAXIMUM CREDIT HOUR LOAD</p>
<p class="basic-text">Undergraduate students may register for up to 18 credit hours per semester, except for the College of Business Administration which allows a maximum of 19 credit hours and the College of Arts and Sciences and the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts which allow a student to register for up to 20 credit hours. Written permission from the college dean is required to exceed the credit hour per semester maximum and must be filed with an Override Authorization Form at the time of registration.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">CLASS ATTENDANCE</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are expected to attend all lectures, recitations, quizzes, and laboratories regularly. The University has no regulation which permits cutting classes.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are responsible for the attendance policy set by instructors and should clear absences directly with them.</p>
<p class="basic-text">In cases where a student is unable to contact his or her instructors due to major illness, serious injury, or hospitalization or when given military orders which are effective immediately, a notice may be sent to the student’s instructors by the University Health Center, a family physician, or the Students Affairs Office, 106 Canfield Administration Building, 402-472-3755. This notice is for the instructor’s information only and does not relieve the student of contacting instructors as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students involved in University-sponsored activities, including intercollegiate athletics, may need to be excused from a class, lab, or studio meeting. In all instances it is the student’s responsibility to request permission for the absence (preferably in writing) from the instructor and to discuss how the absence will affect their ability to meet the course requirements. Students should do this as soon in the semester as possible. While instructors should seek to the greatest extent possible, consistent with course requirements, to make reasonable accommodation for a student involved in University-sponsored activities, students should recognize that not every course can accommodate absences and neither the absence (nor the notification of an absence) relieves them from meeting the course requirements.</p>
<p class="basic-text">For complete information on class attendance, see the Office of the University Registrar's website at http://registrar.unl.edu.</p>

<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Dual Matriculation: </span>A student is earning two bachelors degrees. This requires an additional 30 hours added to the student’s program along with the requirements of both degree colleges. An example would be a student receiving a bachelor of science in business administration and a bachelor of arts in global studies.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Duplicate Credit: </span>A course that has already been taken; a student can’t receive credit in the same course multiple times. This can also define taking two courses which are determined to have corresponding content, outcomes, and level (STAT 218, SOCI 206, EDPS 459, CRIM 300 and ECON 215).</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Education Abroad Credit:</span> Credit earned by a UNL student while studying, interning, researching, or doing service learning outside the United States. Because of variation in educational systems and course work, this credit ideally should be previewed by department faculty before the education abroad experience. Credit transcribed from an institution outside the United States must be reviewed by specific department faculty to evaluate its applicability to the student’s degree program.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Evaluation: </span>Process by which the department/advising office evaluates transfer credit to determine its equivalence to a UNL course based on similar content, level and outcomes.

<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">International Credit (IVAL): </span>Credit earned at an institution outside the United States. Because educational systems vary greatly, all international credit must be reviewed by specific department faculty to evaluate its applicability to a UNL degree. To ease this process, some courses have been reviewed and transfer as direct equivalents.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Incomplete:</span> A grade given, usually under extenuating circumstances, when a student is not able to complete a course within the semester. The professor assigns a grade of incomplete at the end of the semester and works out a contractual agreement for completion. Grades of incomplete do not affect a student’s GPA.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Lower Level (100 or 200 level):</span> General introductory courses, usually making up the first two years of a bachelors degree. Credit awarded by a community college is generally considered lower division credit.</p>

<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Multiple Course Equivalency:</span> A direct equivalence involving a combination of courses. In some cases, the course content is divided differently. An accounting series may be divided into three courses at one institution which are equivalent to two courses at UNL.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">MyPLAN (My Personal Learning and Advising Network):</span> A tool located in My.UNL/Blackboard, used to connect with advisors and instructors. Many offices are using MyPLAN as an on-line appointment system for students as well.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">MyRED:</span> An on-line tool used by students to view and keep track of their academic records, register for courses, see final course grades, view and maintain financial/scholarship processes, etc.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Non Degree Applicable (NDAP): </span>Transfer course credit hours which are included in the equivalency and generally not degree-applicable. For example, if 4 credit hours are awarded for a course at another institution, but the equivalent UNL course awards 3 credit hours, the extra 1 semester hour of transfer credit may be recorded as NDAP and would not apply to the student’s degree. If a transfer course is awarded fewer credit hours than the equivalent UNL course, the evaluator may stipulate that the course will satisfy the requirement for the UNL course, without additional hours.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Open Registration: </span>Following Priority Registration when registration for the upcoming semesters is open to all students.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Override: </span>A professor can give permission for a student to be admitted into a closed course (usually by a schedule adjustment form or permission code).</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Pass/No Pass (P/NP): </span>This option does not affect a student’s GPA and has to be decided by a certain date located in the academic calendar and can be changed in MyRED. Some courses have the option to be taken as P/NP or only offered as P/NP.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Pre-Professional Programs:</span> Pre-Professional is an advising category for students preparing to enter a professional school. Pre-Health and Pre-Law areas are not majors and, therefore, cannot grant students baccalaureate degrees.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Prerequisite: </span>A course/requirement a student must pass before enrollment can take place in a more advanced course in the discipline or in a related discipline. A common prerequisite for calculus is college algebra and trigonometry.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Priority Registration:</span> Student’s registration time based on how many credits have been earned as well as the number of hours in progress (decided by the Office of the University Registrar). Priority Registration for the spring starts in October and ends in November; Priority Registration for the fall/summer starts in March and ends in April.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Probation (academic or disciplinary): </span>A status assigned because of unsatisfactory grades or conduct.</p>

<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Undergraduate Bulletin: </span>The set of rules, regulations, policies, programs, requirements, and courses. This can also be referred to as a catalog. A student is normally bound by the requirements of the bulletin in effect when the student was admitted to the degree college. Each degree college has policies regarding changes to bulletins. The Undergraduate Bulletin can be found at: http://bulletin.unl.edu/undergraduate/.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Upper Level (300 and 400 level): </span>Less general, more focused courses, usually making up most of the final two years of a bachelors degree.</p>

<p class="content-box-h-1">COURSE PREREQUISITES AND COREQUISITES</p>
<p class="basic-text">Course prerequisites indicate the level of preparation a student must have had to take a given course. Equivalent preparation is generally sufficient. If there is doubt about a student’s preparation level, permission to enroll may be requested from the instructor of the course or from the department chairperson. Academic departments reserve the right to deny admission in a course if the prerequisite has not been completed. Academic departments reserve the right to give permission or waive the prerequisite for any course or to substitute for the prerequisite learning obtained by other means than through the prerequisite course(s). See the Courses of Instruction section for each undergraduate college in this bulletin for official listing of course prerequisites.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The use of the words “parallel”, “corequisite”, or “coregister with” in the prerequisite for a course means that both courses are to be taken simultaneously.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">GRADING SYSTEM</p>
<p class="abbreviations-note">The University uses an A through F grading system. The letter grades with point value (in parentheses) are: A+ (4.0), A (4.0), A- (3.67), B+ (3.33), B (3.0), B- (2.67), C+ (2.33), C (2.0), C- (1.67), D+ (1.33), D (1.0), D- (0.67), and F (0). Grades of W (dropped/withdrew), I (incomplete), P (pass/C or better), and N (no pass) may also be given. W, I, P, and N are not assigned grade points and therefore are not used in computation of a student’s grade point average.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">ACADEMIC STANDARDS-INSTITUTIONAL POLICY</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Probation I.</span> Students are placed on Probation I when their term or cumulative GPA falls below 2.0. Students are notified of their status via a letter and email from the Office of the University Registrar. Once students are placed on probation, a hold is placed on their account for future registrations. To remove probation status, students must complete a semester of coursework with both a semester and cumulative GPA above 2.00.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Probation II.</span> Students are placed on Probation II when their term or cumulative GPA falls below 2.0 for two consecutive semesters. Students are notified of their status via a letter and email from the Office of the University Registrar. Once students are placed on probation, a hold is placed on their account for future registrations. To remove probation status, students must complete a semester of coursework with both a semester and cumulative GPA above 2.00.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Academic Dismissal.</span> Dismissal rules are contingent on the total number of credit hours a student has attempted while enrolled at UNL. A student will be dismissed from UNL if any semester ends in the following conditions:</p>
<p class="list">1. If a student has 1-18 cumulative attempted credit hours, has attended UNL, UNO or UNK for more than one semester, and his/her cumulative GPA is below 1.00.</p>
<p class="list">2. If a student has 19-45 cumulative attempted credit hours, his/her prior cumulative GPA is below 2.0, and:</p>
<p class="basic-text">- both semester and cumulative GPA are below 1.75</p>
<p class="basic-text">OR</p>
<p class="basic-text">- the student has spent three consecutive semesters on probation.</p>
<p class="list">3. If a student has 46 or more cumulative attempted credit hours, his/her prior cumulative GPA is below 2.0, and:</p>
<p class="basic-text">- both semester and cumulative GPA are below 2.0</p>
<p class="basic-text">OR</p>
<p class="basic-text">- the student has spent three consecutive semesters on probation.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph">If a student is dismissed, the University will automatically cancel any registrations for the following semester.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph">Decisions made regarding continued eligibility for Federal Financial Aid are made independently of the academic dismissal/reinstatement policy. Students should contact the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid for assistance.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="basic-text-bold">NOTE:</span> Attempted credit hours include all the credit hours a student registered for at UNL and did not drop during the first two weeks of the course.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Readmission.</span> A student who has been dismissed from UNL will be denied enrollment privileges for at least two consecutive semesters (the four summer sessions count as one semester). Readmission to UNL is not automatic. A dismissed student may apply for readmission to UNL for the semester following the mandatory “stop-out” period or any subsequent semesters. Applications for readmission will be evaluated by the Office of Admissions in accordance with criteria established by each of the colleges.</p>

<p class="content-box-h-1">HONORS CONVOCATION RECOGNITION REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p class="basic-text">Honors Convocation recognition requirements for students entering the University after the Spring Semester 2004 require that those eligible for recognition be in the top ten percent of their college class based on their cumulative grade point average (but with a cumulative GPA no lower than 3.6) and meet the additional requirements stated below.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students whose first college matriculation at UNL (after high school graduation) occurred before June 2004 will be recognized on the basis of recognition requirements in force at that time. This policy will also apply to transfer students from UNO and UNK whose first college matriculation at those institutions preceded the June 2004 implementation of the recognition criteria.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Honors Convocation criteria for students entering the University in the 2004-05 academic year and after are listed below. Students will be recognized only for the highest award for which they qualify.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">High Scholarship. </span>Students must be in the top ten percent of their college class based on their cumulative grade point average and meet the following specific requirements:</p>
<p class="list">1. Required semesters in residence at UNL: juniors and seniors must have completed at least 3 semesters or 42 credit hours at UNL; sophomores must have completed at least 2 semesters or 28 credit hours; freshmen must have completed at least 1 semester or 12 credit hours.</p>
<p class="list">2. Hours completed first semester: seniors must complete a minimum of 9 hours, of which 6 must be graded A through F. (Student teachers in the College of Education and Human Sciences may be exceptions.) Students graduating in December may take only those hours needed for graduation. Juniors, sophomores, and freshmen must complete a minimum of 12 hours first (fall) semester, at least 9 of which are graded A through F.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Superior Scholarship.</span> Superior scholarship students are seniors graduating between December and August who: 1) meet the requirements for high scholarship for seniors, and 2) are in the upper three percent of the senior class of their college or have been on the UNL Honors Convocation list each year since matriculation as a freshman.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Chancellor’s Scholars.</span> Seniors graduating between December and August qualify for this award if they meet the following criteria.</p>
<p class="list">1. Graduating seniors must have earned the grade of A in all graded collegiate work at UNL and at other institutions and a grade of P for all classes taken in the Pass/No Pass grading option (excluding foreign study and collegiate work taken prior to the student’s graduation from high school. The student must request the exclusion of a grade taken prior to graduation from high school and the re-calculation of the GPA in writing to the University Honors Program, 118 NRC, 0659, by March 1). At least 42 graded semester hours must have been earned at UNL by the end of first (fall) semester of the academic year of graduation.</p>
<p class="list">2. During first semester, a student must complete a minimum of 9 total hours with no more than 3 hours of Pass/No Pass course work. (Student teachers in the College of Education and Human Sciences may be exceptions.) Students graduating in December may take only those hours needed for graduation.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">General Information for Honors.</span> Students with grade changes or students finishing incompletes after January 1 should contact the Office of the University Honors Program to see that these changes have been recorded.</p>
<p class="basic-text">All grades are averaged in figuring cumulative GPA. Students repeating a class to remove C-, D, or F grades will have both the original and the repeat grade used to calculate GPA.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Only those seniors recognized as Superior Scholars and Chancellor’s Scholars (see above) need to order caps and gowns for the Honors Convocation ceremonies. The Honors Convocation invitation will give appropriate instructions.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">NOTE:</span> Only University of Nebraska system grades are used to compute the GPA for Honors. For computing the GPA for Honors, a student may request the exclusion of a University of Nebraska system grade earned in a course taken prior to graduation from high school. This request for a re-calculation of the GPA must be made in writing to the University Honors Program, 118 NRC, 0659, prior to March 1. UNL, UNO, UNK, and UNMC students are considered resident students.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">NOTE:</span> Each college also has their own recognition.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">RECOGNITION OF OUTSTANDING ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT</p>
<p class="basic-text">In addition to providing qualified students with an opportunity to enrich their academic programs by taking honors courses, the University and its colleges recognize the academic achievements of all their talented and dedicated students.</p>
<p class="title-3">The Honors Convocation: University and Chancellor’s Scholars</p>
<p class="basic-text">In April of each year, the Chancellor hosts the All-University Honors Convocation at which students who meet recognition requirements are honored as University Scholars. Special recognition is given to Chancellor’s Scholars, graduating seniors who have maintained a perfect 4.0 grade point in all their collegiate work.</p>
<p class="title-3">The Dean’s List: College Scholars</p>
<p class="basic-text">Each semester, the eight undergraduate colleges identify students who perform at a superior level academically by recording their names on the Dean’s List of the respective colleges. These College Scholars have earned at least a B+ average in a specified number of courses (the standard varies from college to college) during the semester for which they are recognized.</p>
<p class="title-3">Graduation with Distinction in UNL’s Undergraduate Colleges</p>
<p class="basic-text">The colleges also praise their most successful students by recommending them for graduation with distinction, high distinction or highest distinction. While the manner of selection varies from college to college, all graduates with a level of distinction upon graduation have earned the respect of both the university community and the larger society they are about to join. Acknowledgment of such achievement is made publicly at commencement and, of course, is indicated on the student’s diploma.</p>
<p class="title-2">Departmental Honors</p>
<p class="basic-text">Many academic departments offer honors courses and provide high-ability students with special research opportunities. Students who do not participate in the University Honors Program may request permission to register for an honors course from the course instructor or the department office. Refer to college and departmental listings in this bulletin for further information or contact the University Honors Program Office.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">GRADING POLICIES</p>
<p class="basic-text">University faculty members are expected to inform students early in the semester of course objectives, requirements, standards, and grading procedures for the particular course. In addition, they should make clear their individual policies regarding the Pass/No Pass grading option and the assignment of I (incomplete) grades. Failure of any faculty member to inform students of special restrictions in these areas could be grounds for a grade appeal case. Grade appeal procedures exist in all UNL undergraduate colleges (see Grade Appeals in individual undergraduate college sections of this bulletin).</p>
<p class="title-3">Pass/No Pass Grading Option</p>
<p class="basic-text">The Pass/No Pass grading option was designed to enable students to take courses in areas of interest where they may feel they have had minimal preparation without adversely affecting their grade point average. Grades of P (pass) are interpreted as a grade of C or better. Neither grade P or N (no pass) contributes to the grade point average.</p>
<p class="basic-text">There are collegiate restrictions on the use of this grading option. Students should see Pass/No Pass in individual undergraduate college sections of this bulletin, see the Office of the University Registrar's website at http://registrar.unl.edu, and talk with their academic advisors concerning the use of this option.</p>
<p class="title-3">Grades of Incomplete</p>
<p class="basic-text">The grade I is used by an instructor at the end of a term to designate incomplete work in a course. It should be used only when students are unable to complete the requirements of the course in the term in which they are registered because of illness, military service, hardship, or death in the immediate family. Incompletes should only be given if the student has already substantially completed the major requirements of the course.</p>
<p class="basic-text">For complete procedures and regulations, see the Office of the University Registrar's website at http://registrar.unl.edu.</p>
<p class="title-3">Course Repeat Policy</p>
<p class="basic-text">Only the most recent letter grade received in a given course will be used in computing a student’s cumulative grade point average if the student has completed the course more than once and previously received a grade or grades below C in that course.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The previous grade (or grades) will not be used in computation of the cumulative grade point average, but it will remain a part of the academic record and will appear on any transcript.</p>
<p class="basic-text">A student can remove from his/her cumulative average a course grade of C-, D+, D, D-, or F if the student repeats the equivalent course at the University of Nebraska and receives a grade other than P (pass), I (incomplete), N (no pass), W (withdrew), or NR (no report). If a course is no longer being offered, it is not eligible for the removal process.</p>
<p class="basic-text">For complete procedures and regulations, see the Office of the University Registrar's website at http://registrar.unl.edu.</p>
<p class="title-3">Automatic Removal of Grade Factors From Cumulative GPA For Repeated Courses</p>
<p class="basic-text">Courses graded A+ to F for the current semester are checked against all courses taken since the installation of the computerized records system (September, 1986) and grade factors are automatically subtracted for repeated courses originally graded C-, D+, D, D-, or F.</p>
<p class="title-3">Exceptions to Automatic Grade Factor Removal Processing</p>
<p class="basic-text">Independent study courses, special topics courses and variable credit hour courses will not be processed automatically. These courses will be identified to the Registrar’s Office to check the C-, D+, D, D- or F status manually. Any of these courses that qualify for removal will be processed manually by the Registrar’s Office. The student will be notified of the change by a Grade Notification letter.</p>
<p class="title-3">Students must complete an “Undergraduate Course Repeat Re-Computation Request” for the following situations:</p>
<p class="list">1. Repeated courses that were first taken prior to the First Semester 1986-87.</p>
<p class="list">2. UNMC, UNO, UNK equivalent course.</p>
<p class="list">3. Late grades or grade changes after the grade census date (approximately three weeks after the end of the term).</p>
<p class="list">4. Cross-listed courses (i.e., FINA 365/ECON 365).</p>
<p class="basic-text">Requests for course repeat(s) processing for these exception-type situations are available at, and must be submitted to the Office of the University Registrar, 107 Canfield Administration Building, approximately three weeks after the end of the term. Removals processed during this revision period will be reflected in the official (census date) cumulative grade point average. Students not meeting this deadline will be notified of the change approximately two weeks after the request is received. Late changes will not be reflected in the official (census date) cumulative grade point average.</p>
<p class="title-2">Academic Bankruptcy</p>
<p class="basic-text">A student may remove one or two complete semesters of work from their cumulative grade point average and degree consideration by applying to the Office of the University Registrar for academic bankruptcy. To qualify, a student must have completed either 15 simultaneous or sequential credit hours with a minimum 3.0 grade point average or 30 hours with a minimum 2.5 grade point average at UNL following the semester(s) the student wishes to remove.</p>
<p class="basic-text">In order to declare a semester bankrupt, all courses taken during the semester are bankrupt (both credit hours and grades). The bankrupt semester is removed from consideration for cumulative grade point average purposes and the bankrupt credit is not used for degree requirements. The semester listing of courses and grades remain evident on the academic record which is used to issue transcripts. A student may not bankrupt a semester after receiving a baccalaureate degree. College Independent Study via On-line and Distance Education is not included in computing qualifying grade point averages; P grades may not be used to meet bankruptcy requirements.</p>
<p class="basic-text">For complete procedures and regulations, see the Office of the University Registrar's website at http://registrar.unl.edu.</p>
<p class="title-2">Advanced Placement</p>
<p class="basic-text">In order to help students gain credit by advanced standing, the University provides opportunities for advanced placement. UNL participates in the Advanced Placement Program (AP) of the College Entrance Examination Board and the College Level Examination Program (CLEP). Students can obtain detailed information on acceptable courses from the Office of Admissions.</p>
<p class="title-2">Credit by Examination</p>
<p class="basic-text">Some currently-enrolled students, through outside study or relevant experience, may feel prepared to demonstrate that they have attained the knowledge and/or skills required to pass a particular UNL course. As an alternative to enrolling in the course, such students may elect to take a proficiency exam which tests for mastery of the course material. If a student scores satisfactorily on the examination, the student may be awarded credit for the course. Students can obtain detailed information from the dean’s office of their college.</p>
<p class="title-1"> Academic Advisor Assignment</p>
<p class="basic-text">The University considers faculty contact with students essential to academic planning and University life. Undergraduate students are assigned academic advisors through the college or department in which they are majoring. Undergraduate students who have not yet decided upon a college will be referred to an academic advisor in the Exploratory and Pre-Professional Advising Center.</p>
