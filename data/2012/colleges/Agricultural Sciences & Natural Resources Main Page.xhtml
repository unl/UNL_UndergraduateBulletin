Both the student and the instructor will be given an opportunity to present materials to the committee in the presence of each other.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Honors Program</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources encourages qualified students to participate in the University Honors Program which is a UNL-wide program. The College’s honors students pursue degree programs offered by the College while completing the required honors courses. </p>
				<p class="basic-text">All University Honors Program students are expected to complete a mentored thesis project with a faculty member of their choosing. Students should enroll in AGRI 299H in the spring semester of their sophomore year. As a part of AGRI 299H, students will identify a faculty thesis mentor and write a thesis proposal with their faculty thesis mentor. Because of the breadth of degrees, the program relies on faculty mentors within individual degree programs to determine the criteria for an undergraduate thesis in their area of endeavor. General guidance for mentors is provided as requested by Dr. Madhavan Soundararajan.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The Agricultural Research Division supports a competitive grants program to assist the College’s Honors Program students in the pursuit of their mentored theses.

				<p class="title-1">Natural Resources Program</p>
				<p class="faculty-list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">Advising Coordinator:</span> Sara Winn, 102A Hardin Hall</p>
				<p class="faculty-list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">Website:</span> snr.unl.edu/undergrad/programs/index-programs.asp</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Natural Resources programs in CASNR emphasize an interdisciplinary approach to undergraduate and graduate education while providing students with a strong grounding in the program of their choice. The School of Natural Resources (SNR) is the administrative home to the natural resources programs: Environmental Restoration Science, Environmental Studies (Applied Climate Science emphasis and Natural Resources emphasis), Fisheries and Wildlife, Grassland Ecology and Management, Pre-Forestry, and Water Science. The SNR is comprised of faculty from units within the Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources (IANR), the College of Arts and Sciences, and other University colleges who focus on many critical natural resources and environmental issues.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Specific requirements for each program are listed under each program description. </p>
				<p class="basic-text">Courses of instruction in the natural resources programs provide students with the tools to describe the characteristics of natural resource systems which include the atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, and biosphere. In addition, graduates of these programs are expected to be able to understand the interactions among natural resource systems and to evaluate the impacts of humans as stewards and managers of these systems. Along with this technical expertise, each student will develop problem solving and communications skills which will enable them to take their place as a professional in a diversity of natural resources careers.</p>
				<p class="title-3">Scholarships</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The School of Natural Resources annually awards scholarships to freshmen and upperclassmen worth more than $25,000. Scholarship awards are made possible through generous gifts of alumni, local and state organizations, and private donors. </p>
				<p class="basic-text">Most SNR scholarships are based on academic performance and do not require an application. A number of scholarships are available. For more information on these scholarships contact Dr. Dave Wedin, Scholarship Committee Chair, or visit http://snr.unl.edu/undergrad/funding/scholarships.asp. </p>
				<p class="title-3">Academic Advising</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students are assigned a faculty adviser after admission into their programs. The adviser serves as a resource regarding the degree, academic plans and progress, and career options. Students are encouraged to regularly consult with their adviser, especially before registering for classes. The natural resources advising coordinator assists the faculty advisers with student consultations, is a resource for internship and employment opportunities, and will assist students in reviewing their academic records and course options.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Pre-Professional Programs</p>
				<p class="title-2">Integrated Science Program</p>
				<p class="faculty-list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">Coordinator:</span> Associate Dean Dann Husmann, 103 Agricultural Hall</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Many students are unsure of which degree program to choose when entering the university. In fact, over half of all students entering UNL change their degree program at least once. The following program is available for students not yet ready to make the decision.</p>
				<p class="title-3">Integrated Science</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The courses listed below compose a non-degree program entitled Integrated Science. The program is designed for students who are interested in a bachelor of science degree in the applied life sciences, agricultural sciences, natural resource sciences, or social sciences offered in the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, but are uncertain about a specific degree program. Such students will receive individualized advising and mentoring from a faculty member and be encouraged to participate in clubs and other pre-professional activities to help them decide which career path is right for them.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">This list of suggested courses for the first semester should provide the student maximum flexibility while ensuring that courses contribute to any of the degree programs within the College as well as most programs in other colleges. During the first semester, students should contact Associate Dean Dann Husmann to identify an appropriate adviser(s) in a degree program(s) of their area of interest to plan appropriate courses for subsequent semesters. Students may be in the program for two years (62 credit hours). Students may declare a degree program at any time, but must declare a degree program at the completion of 62 hours.</p>

				<p class="faculty-list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">Coordinator: Professor James R. Brandle,</span> School of Natural Resources, 407 Hardin Hall</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Forestry deals with the development and use of forests and related lands for a variety of uses– wood, water, wildlife, forage, recreation, and aesthetics. Multiple use is the foundation upon which management of our national forests is based; foresters today, through their forest management programs, are expected to provide a broad array of benefits to meet public demands. Students graduating from forestry programs find employment with federal, state, and local governments, and with private industry.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">CASNR offers a two-year pre-forestry program, but does not offer a four-year forestry degree. Students must transfer at the end of their freshman or sophomore year. Graduate training in forestry is offered by the School of Natural Resources.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The pre-forestry curriculum consists of 60-70 hours selected from the courses listed below. Course selection is based on a student’s background and career goals. A program of study will be developed by the student and the adviser that involves one or two years at the University of Nebraska before transferring to the University of Missouri or another accredited forestry school. If a student desires to enter the University of Nebraska and later transfer to a forestry school other than the University of Missouri, the student should obtain information about the school’s entrance requirements and curriculum as early as possible to avoid unnecessary loss of credit.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">An agreement with the University of Missouri allows Nebraska residents with the proper scholastic qualifications to enter that institution without paying out-of-state fees. Under this program a student may enter the University of Missouri directly from high school or transfer after one or two years at the University of Nebraska.

				<p class="basic-text">Law schools prefer students with broad academic backgrounds. Accordingly, there is no “prelaw” designation. Study toward a bachelor of science degree is excellent prelaw curriculum. There are no particular degree programs or courses students are advised to take to enhance their chances of admission to law school. Students should choose programs and courses that interest them. However, students should take many courses that require writing and complex readings. Students, especially those uncertain about law school, may want to take some courses that focus on law and the courts. While these courses will not enhance chances of admission, they will provide information about the legal system and the legal profession.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Prospective applicants are advised to take the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) during the summer before their last year or the fall of their last year. Information and application materials are available from the Career Services. The Official Guide to US Law Schools, available from the LSAT organization, contains material about the legal profession, the law school experience, the application process, and the individualized information on all American law schools approved by the American Bar Association.</p>

				<p class="basic-text">Individuals wishing to enter the four-year professional curriculum leading to the degree, doctor of veterinary medicine (DVM), must first complete two or more years of pre-veterinary general education. Courses taken during pre-professional education must satisfy the entrance prerequisites for the college of veterinary medicine of the person’s choice. At the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, it usually requires a minimum of three years to complete the pre-professional requirements, but students must declare an acceptable degree program at the conclusion of their sophomore year. Certain options in the veterinary science and veterinary technology degree programs meet the pre-veterinary requirements of colleges of veterinary medicine. 8 The student should discuss special variations and other colleges of interest with their academic adviser at the earliest possible date.</p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="basic-text-bold">The Pre-Veterinary Program IS NOT a degree-granting program. </span>Completion of the pre-professional program alone in fulfilling the prerequisites for admission to a college or school of veterinary medicine does not result in the awarding of a degree from the University of Nebraska. Students are to select an appropriate field within which to work toward a college degree while concurrently working toward completion of pre-professional requirements. Students are encouraged to consider courses of study with a degree-granting program in veterinary science (biomedical science, microbiology options, or veterinary medicine options), veterinary technology, animal science, food science and technology, biochemistry or other fields compatible with the pre-professional program that leads to a bachelor of science degree. Students can also complete pre-veterinary prerequisites with a degree program in wildlife or environmental studies, leading to a bachelor of science degree. It is also possible to pursue these pre-veterinary requirements in degree-granting programs outside the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, such as the College of Arts and Sciences.</p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="basic-text-bold">Students are expected to designate an acceptable degree program by the end of their sophomore year and to work with an adviser in that field. </span>Additional advisory support relating to pre-professional requirements and admission policies is provided by advisers within the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, University of Nebraska–Lincoln.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The program utilizes an “Advising Plus” model which involves faculty from the School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences (Laura Hardin, Rodney Moxley, and Michael Carlson) and the Department of Animal Science (Dennis Brink and Thomas Burkey). Team advising will be utilized to expose students to all the opportunities in animal health and assist them in identifying the appropriate degree program.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students interested in veterinary medicine are encouraged to participate in the Pre-veterinary Club to learn about the exciting advancement and developments within the profession.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">It is not recommended that pre-veterinary students take any courses on a Pass/No Pass basis (unless this is the only grading option for a given course, e.g. VBMS 101) because courses taken Pass/No Pass may not be accepted for pre-professional prerequisites. Letter grades are required to evaluate credentials of applicants for veterinary college admission.</p>
