				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Mission</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">UNL’s College of Arts and Sciences empowers students with a world-class education befitting the State of Nebraska’s comprehensive, land-grant, research university. Our teaching in the humanities and social and natural sciences gives students the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in an increasingly complex, diverse and interconnected world. We are equally committed to increasing knowledge through research endeavors and creative activities at the leading edge of human experience, and our expertise in service and outreach furthers the interests of Nebraska, the nation, and the world. Our guiding principle is that teaching, research, and service are inextricably intertwined, enhancing our ability to provide an outstanding education.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Careers</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The College’s comprehensive liberal arts education empowers graduates to pursue unlimited career possibilities. Arts and Sciences students develop strengths as communicators, critical thinkers, problem solvers and lifelong learners who can see the big picture. They have the skills and adaptability that employers universally value. Graduates are not only prepared to effectively compete in the real world, but they have a solid foundation to excel in an increasingly global, technological and interdisciplinary world.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Often there is no direct link between a student’s academic major and career choice. A student does not have to be a biology major to become a physician. Not all history majors become historians. An English major could become a lawyer.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Arts and Sciences students have access to a powerful network of faculty and advisers dedicated to providing information, support and hands-on experience through engaging course work, co-curricular activities and service opportunities to aid in the career-planning process.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The College works closely with Career Services, 230 Nebraska Union, to help students with their career planning. In addition, the chief advisers provide information and guidance.</span></p>
				<p class="content-box-m-p"><span class="generated-style">ADMISSION</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">College Admission </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The entrance requirements for the College of Arts and Sciences are the same as the UNL General Admission Requirements. Students who are admitted through the Admission by Review process with core course deficiencies will have certain conditions attached to their enrollment at UNL. These conditions are explained under “Removal of Deficiencies.”</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">In addition to these requirements, the College of Arts and Sciences strongly recommends a third and fourth year of languages. Four years of high school language will exempt students from the College of Arts and Sciences’ language requirement. It will also allow students to continue language study at a more advanced level, and give more opportunity to study abroad.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Transfer Students</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">To be considered for admission a transfer student, Nebraska resident or nonresident, must have an accumulated average of C (2.0 on a 4.0 scale) and a minimum C average in the last semester of attendance at another college. Transfer students who graduated from high school January 1997 and after must also meet the UNL General Admissions Requirements. Those transfer students who graduated before January 1997 must have completed in high school 3 years of English, 2 years of the same foreign language, 2 years of algebra, and 1 year of geometry. Transfer students who have completed less than 12 credit hours of college study must submit either the ACT or SAT scores.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Ordinarily, hours earned at an accredited college are accepted by the University. The College, however, will evaluate all hours submitted on an application for transfer and reserves the right to accept or reject any of them. Sixty-six is the maximum number of hours the University will accept on transfer from a two-year college. Transfer credit in the major must be approved by the major adviser on a Request for Substitution Form to meet specific course requirements, group requirements, or course level requirements in the major. At least half of the hours in the major field must be completed at the University regardless of the number of hours transferred.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The College of Arts and Sciences will accept no more than 15 semester hours of C- and D grades from other schools. The C- and D grades cannot be applied toward requirements for a major or minor. This policy does not apply to the transfer of grades from UNO or UNK to UNL. All D grades may be transferred from UNO or UNK, but they are not applicable to a major or minor.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Readmitted Students</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students readmitted to the College of Arts and Sciences will follow the requirements stated in the bulletin for the academic year of readmission and reenrollment as a degree-seeking student in Arts and Sciences. In consultation with advisers, a student may choose to follow a bulletin for any academic year in which they are admitted to and enrolled as a degree-seeking student at UNL in the College of Arts and Sciences. Students must complete all degree requirements from a single bulletin year. Beginning in 1990-1991, the bulletin which a student follows for degree requirements may not be more than 10 years old at the time of graduation.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Admission Deficiencies/Removal of Deficiencies </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">You must remove entrance deficiencies before you can graduate from the College of Arts and Sciences. For students entering August 1997 or later and who graduated from high school January 1997 and after, courses taken to remove a high school core course deficiency may not be counted toward either the major, minor, or college degree requirements. They may be counted in Achievement-Centered Education (ACE) and the “electives” categories in meeting degree requirements. The most common deficiencies are in foreign languages and mathematics.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Removing Foreign Language Deficiencies</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">A student who has had fewer than two years of one foreign language in high school will need 130 semester hours as a minimum for a degree from the College of Arts and Sciences. A student will also need to complete the “102” course in a language to clear the deficiency and the “202” course to complete the college graduation requirement in language.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Removing Mathematics Deficiencies</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">1. A deficiency of one year of geometry can be removed by taking two high school geometry courses by Independent Study or by completing a geometry course from an accredited community college or a four-year institution. Neither of these options count for college credit.</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">2. A deficiency of the first year of algebra can be removed by taking two high school Algebra I courses through Extended Education (not for college credit).</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">3. A deficiency of the second year of algebra can be removed by taking MATH 95C (not for college credit) or MATH 100A (may be taken for college credit but does not apply toward graduation).</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">4. A student whose deficiency is the additional (fourth) year of mathematics that builds on algebra must successfully complete one of the following: MATH 101, MATH 102, MATH 103, STAT 218, ECON 215, EDPS 459, or SOCI 206 or an equivalent course at another institution.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Removing Other Deficiencies</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Contact the Arts and Sciences Advising Center for specific courses to remove other entrance deficiencies.</span></p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1"><span class="generated-style">ADVISING</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Academic Advising</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">All students in the College of Arts and Sciences are assigned to an academic adviser or advising center based on their academic interests. Advisers will help students plan their academic careers, understand degree requirements, and identify courses to meet those requirements. Specially trained advisers from the Arts and Sciences Advising Center counsel all incoming freshmen during New Student Enrollment.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students in the College who have declared a major will be assigned a chief major adviser in their major field of study. Students who have declared a pre-health or pre-law area of interest will work with advisers in the Advising Center, specifically trained to guide students preparing to enter a professional school. All students in the College should also meet with professional advisers in the Arts and Sciences Advising Center to answer questions related to choosing majors and minors, understanding degree requirements and degree audits, completing paperwork, understanding deadlines, adding/dropping courses, and planning for graduation. The professional advisers in the Advising Center are available on an appointment and/or walk-in basis Monday through Friday. Students who have questions should contact the Advising Center.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">For complete and current information on chief advisers for majors, minors, and pre-health areas and pre-law, contact the Arts and Sciences Advising Center, 107 Oldfather Hall, 402-472-4190, http://ascweb.unl.edu/advisingcenter.html.</span></p>

				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Through study or experience that parallels a University of Nebraska–Lincoln course, a regularly enrolled University student may feel prepared to pass an examination on the course content of a specific course for credit in that course. To apply for credit, a student should:</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">1. Consult with the department chair.</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">2. Obtain a Credit by Examination Form at the Records Office, 107 Canfield Administration Building, 402-472-3649. Current enrollment in the University must also be verified.</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">3. Secure the approval signature from the department chair, instructor, and the dean of the student’s college. The Dean’s signature can be obtained in the Arts and Sciences Advising Center, 107 Oldfather.</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">4. Secure the bursar’s receipt for payment of the appropriate fee per course for credit by examination. Currently, the fee is one-half the resident tuition rate.</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">5. Present the completed form to the instructor designated by the department chair. The instructor will give the examination and report the results on the Credit by Examination Form to the Admissions Office, Alexander Building, 402-472-0130.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Examination for credit through UNL departments may be taken only by currently enrolled students. A student is not permitted to receive credit by examination in a course which is a prerequisite for a course already taken unless the course and its prerequisites cover essentially different subject matter.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The College of Arts and Sciences also gives credit for the subject and general examinations of the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) and the Advanced Placement (AP) Program administered by the College Entrance Examination Board. See the Arts and Sciences Advising Center, 107 Oldfather Hall, for current policy regarding CLEP and AP examinations.</span></p>

				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Two Degrees from Arts and Sciences</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">A graduate who holds the bachelor of arts degree may earn the bachelor of science degree by completing an additional year of work in residence taking at least 30 more semester hours of course work for a minimum of 155 hours. The student must complete all degree requirements for the second degree, including the scientific base. A graduate who holds the bachelor of science degree may earn the bachelor of arts degree by completing another year of work in residence taking at least 30 semester hours of additional course work for a minimum of 155 hours. The student must complete all degree requirements for the second degree.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Two Degrees from UNL</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">A graduate who holds a bachelors degree from another college at UNL may earn the bachelor of science or bachelor of arts degree from the College of Arts and Sciences by completing an additional year of work in residence taking at least 30 more semester hours of course work beyond the first degree.

In addition to ACE and College of Journalism and Mass Communications requirements, students will be expected to meet all College of Arts and Sciences distribution requirements and major requirements. Because students choosing this option will not be earning a degree from arts and sciences, they will not be eligible for arts and sciences-based scholarships and aid, but they will be eligible for consideration for Phi Beta Kappa.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Transfer Students with a Non-UNL Degree</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style"> A transfer student who has received a bachelors degree from another institution must complete at least 30 hours of credit in residence at UNL in addition to transfer credit.

				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Areas of Study for the Major</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students are advised to choose a major before the end of the sophomore year to avoid extending the period of time necessary to complete the degree. By gaining a deeper knowledge of one field, the student will further his or her general liberal education, prepare for a career in his or her specialization, and possibly advance to graduate work or a professional program. It is sometimes possible, through careful planning, for students to complete more than one undergraduate major. Students should consult their advisers about this possibility. The student who majors in more than one field will be assigned to an adviser in each field.</span></p>
