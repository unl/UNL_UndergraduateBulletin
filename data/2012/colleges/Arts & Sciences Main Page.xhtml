				<p class="title-1">Mission</p>
				<p class="basic-text">UNL’s College of Arts and Sciences empowers students with a world-class education befitting the State of Nebraska’s comprehensive, land-grant, research university. Our teaching in the humanities and social and natural sciences gives students the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in an increasingly complex, diverse and interconnected world. We are equally committed to increasing knowledge through research endeavors and creative activities at the leading edge of human experience, and our expertise in service and outreach furthers the interests of Nebraska, the nation, and the world. Our guiding principle is that teaching, research, and service are inextricably intertwined, enhancing our ability to provide an outstanding education.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Careers</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The College’s comprehensive liberal arts education empowers graduates to pursue unlimited career possibilities. Arts and Sciences students develop strengths as communicators, critical thinkers, problem solvers and lifelong learners who can see the big picture. They have the skills and adaptability that employers universally value. Graduates are not only prepared to effectively compete in the real world, but they have a solid foundation to excel in an increasingly global, technological and interdisciplinary world.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Often there is no direct link between a student’s academic major and career choice. A student does not have to be a biology major to become a physician. Not all history majors become historians. An English major could become a lawyer.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Arts and Sciences students have access to a powerful network of faculty and advisers dedicated to providing information, support and hands-on experience through engaging course work, co-curricular activities and service opportunities to aid in the career-planning process.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The College works closely with Career Services, 230 Nebraska Union, to help students with their career planning. In addition, the chief advisers provide information and guidance.</p>
				<p class="content-box-m-p">ADMISSION</p>
				<p class="title-1">College Admission </p>
				<p class="basic-text">The entrance requirements for the College of Arts and Sciences are the same as the UNL General Admission Requirements. Students who are admitted through the Admission by Review process may have certain conditions attached to their enrollment at UNL. These conditions are explained under “Removal of Deficiencies.”</p>
				<p class="basic-text">In addition to these requirements, the College of Arts and Sciences strongly recommends a third and fourth year of languages. Four years of high school language will exempt students from the College of Arts and Sciences’ language requirement. It will also allow students to continue language study at a more advanced level, and give more opportunity to study abroad.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Transfer Students</p>
				<p class="basic-text">To be considered for admission a transfer student, Nebraska resident or nonresident, must have an accumulated average of C (2.0 on a 4.0 scale) and a minimum C average in the last semester of attendance at another college. Transfer students who graduated from high school January 1997 and after must also meet the UNL General Admissions Requirements. Those transfer students who graduated before January 1997 must have completed in high school 3 years of English, 2 years of the same foreign language, 2 years of algebra, and 1 year of geometry. Transfer students who have completed less than 12 credit hours of college study must submit either the ACT or SAT scores.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Ordinarily, hours earned at an accredited college are accepted by the University. The College, however, will evaluate all hours submitted on an application for transfer and reserves the right to accept or reject any of them. Sixty is the maximum number of hours the University will accept on transfer from a two-year college. Transfer credit in the major must be approved by the major adviser on a Request for Substitution Form to meet specific course requirements, group requirements, or course level requirements in the major. At least half of the hours in the major field must be completed at the University regardless of the number of hours transferred.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The College of Arts and Sciences will accept no more than 15 semester hours of C- and D grades from other schools. The C- and D grades cannot be applied toward requirements for a major or minor. This policy does not apply to the transfer of grades from UNO or UNK to UNL. All D grades may be transferred from UNO or UNK, but they are not applicable to a major or minor.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Readmitted Students</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students readmitted to the College of Arts and Sciences will follow the requirements stated in the bulletin for the academic year of readmission and reenrollment as a degree-seeking student in Arts and Sciences. In consultation with advisers, a student may choose to follow a bulletin for any academic year in which they are admitted to and enrolled as a degree-seeking student at UNL in the College of Arts and Sciences. Students must complete all degree requirements from a single bulletin year. Beginning in 1990-1991, the bulletin which a student follows for degree requirements may not be more than 10 years old at the time of graduation.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Admission Deficiencies/Removal of Deficiencies </p>
				<p class="basic-text">You must remove entrance deficiencies in geometry and foreign language before you can graduate from the College of Arts and Sciences.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Removing Foreign Language Deficiencies</p>
				<p class="basic-text">A student will need to complete the second semester of the first year language sequence to clear the deficiency and the second semester of the second year language sequence to complete the college graduation requirement in language.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Removing Geometry Deficiencies</p>
				<p class="basic-text">A deficiency of one year of geometry can be removed by taking two high school geometry courses by Independent Study or by completing a geometry course from an accredited community college or a four-year institution. Neither of these options count for college credit.</p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1">ADVISING</p>
				<p class="title-1">Academic Advising</p>
				<p class="basic-text">All students in the College of Arts and Sciences are assigned to an academic adviser or advising center based on their academic interests. Advisers will help students plan their academic careers, understand degree requirements, and identify courses to meet those requirements. Specially trained advisers from the Arts and Sciences Advising Center counsel all incoming freshmen during New Student Enrollment.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students in the College who have declared a major will be assigned a chief major adviser in their major field of study. Students who have declared a pre-health or pre-law area of interest will work with advisers in the Advising Center, specifically trained to guide students preparing to enter a professional school. All students in the College should also meet with professional advisers in the Arts and Sciences Advising Center to answer questions related to choosing majors and minors, understanding degree requirements and degree audits, completing paperwork, understanding deadlines, adding/dropping courses, and planning for graduation. The professional advisers in the Advising Center are available on an appointment and/or walk-in basis Monday through Friday. Students who have questions should contact the Advising Center.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">For complete and current information on chief advisers for majors, minors, and pre-health areas and pre-law, contact the Arts and Sciences Advising Center, 107 Oldfather Hall, 402-472-4190, http://ascweb.unl.edu/advisingcenter.html.</p>

				<p class="title-1">Credit by Examination</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Through study or experience that parallels a University of Nebraska–Lincoln course, a regularly enrolled University student may feel prepared to pass an examination on the course content of a specific course for credit in that course. To apply for credit, a student should:</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">1. Consult with the department chair.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">2. Obtain a Credit by Examination Form at the Records Office, 107 Canfield Administration Building, 402-472-3649. Current enrollment in the University must also be verified.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">3. Secure the approval signature from the department chair, instructor, and the dean of the student’s college. The Dean’s signature can be obtained in the Arts and Sciences Advising Center, 107 Oldfather.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">4. Secure the bursar’s receipt for payment of the appropriate fee per course for credit by examination. Currently, the fee is one-half the resident tuition rate.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">5. Present the completed form to the instructor designated by the department chair. The instructor will give the examination and report the results on the Credit by Examination Form to the Admissions Office, Alexander Building, 402-472-0130.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Examination for credit through UNL departments may be taken only by currently enrolled students. A student is not permitted to receive credit by examination in a course which is a prerequisite for a course already taken unless the course and its prerequisites cover essentially different subject matter.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The College of Arts and Sciences also gives credit for the subject and general examinations of the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) and the Advanced Placement (AP) Program administered by the College Entrance Examination Board. See the Arts and Sciences Advising Center, 107 Oldfather Hall, for current policy regarding CLEP and AP examinations.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Dual Degrees</p>

				<p class="content-box-m-p">COLLEGE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS</p>
				<p class="title-1">College General Education Requirements </p>
				<p class="basic-text">The College of Arts and Sciences distribution requirements are designed to further the purposes of liberal education by encouraging study in several different areas. Courses satisfying these requirements may impart specialized knowledge or broadly connect the subject matter to other areas of knowledge. </p>
				<p class="basic-text">All requirements are in addition to University ACE requirements. A student may not use a single course to satisfy more than one of the following five distribution requirements. A student cannot use a single course to satisfy both an ACE outcome and a College distribution requirement. A student cannot use a course from their major to satisfy the Breadth Requirement (F), but may apply an ancillary requirement of the primary major or a course from their second major toward this requirement. Independent study or reading courses and internships cannot be used to satisfy distribution requirements. To see a complete list of excluded courses, run a degree audit through MyRED.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Courses from interdisciplinary programs will count in the same area as courses from the home/cross-listed department(s).</p>
				<p class="title-2">Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science (16 credits + Language)</p>
				<p class="requirement-sec-1">A. Written Communication: 3 hours </p>

				<p class="title-1">Foreign Languages/Language Requirement</p>
				<p class="title-2">Languages Exemption Policy</p>
				<p class="basic-text">UNL and Arts and Sciences will exempt or waive students from the UNL entrance requirement of two years of the same foreign language or from the College’s language distribution requirement based on documentation only. The following are the options and procedures for documentation:</p>
				<p class="title-3">High School Transcripts</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">1. For the University entrance requirements, students must show an official high school transcript with two or more years of the same foreign language in high school.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">2. For the College of Arts and Sciences College Distribution Requirements Area 5 languages requirement, students must show an official high school transcript with four or more years of the same foreign language in high school, or show evidence of graduation from a non-English-speaking foreign high school.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">3. For the College of Arts and Sciences College Distribution Requirements Area 5 languages requirement, students whose native language is not English must show English as a Second Language study on an official high school transcript. Four years of ESL at the high school level (9th, 10th, 11th and 12th grades) will be the basis for a waiver of the Area I Language requirement.</p>
				<p class="title-3">Proficiency Examination at UNL</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">1. For the University entrance requirement, students who do not have transcript documentation can request to take a proficiency exam in the language. (This is not the same test as the Modern Languages Placement Exam.) However, UNL will provide testing only in the languages it teaches. Currently, these languages are:</p>
				<p class="list-indent">Arabic</p>
				<p class="list-indent">French</p>
				<p class="list-indent">German</p>
				<p class="list-indent">Spanish</p>
				<p class="list-indent">Russian</p>
				<p class="list-indent">Czech</p>
				<p class="list-indent">Japanese</p>
				<p class="list-indent">Chinese</p>
				<p class="list-indent">The Department of Modern Languages will oversee the test and provide written documentation to the Admissions Office that the student has passed the proficiency test at the 102 level.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">2. For the College of Arts and Sciences College Distribution Requirements Area 5 requirement, the Department of Modern Languages will oversee the test at the 202 level. If the student passes the test, the department will sign the College Request for Waiver form and indicate the level of proficiency. The form is then forwarded to the Arts and Sciences Advising Center for approval.</p>
				<p class="title-3">Distance Education</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">1. For the University entrance requirement, students without transcript documentation who claim proficiency in a language not taught at UNL, have the option of seeking out a distance education program in languages. If the student completes the equivalent of 102 from an approved distance education program, the student will meet the UNL entrance requirement. The student must have the course work approved before he/she takes/completes the course as equivalent to 102 by the modern languages department. The student then completes the course and has the distance education program send the transcript to the Admissions Office.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">2. For the College of Arts and Sciences College Distribution Requirements Area 5 languages, the student can seek out a distance education program and complete the equivalent of the 202-level course. The student must submit the request on the College Request for Substitution form and have the course work approved by the Department of Modern Languages and the assistant dean for Advising Services. The student then completes the course and has the distance education program send the transcript to the Admissions Office.</p>
				<p class="title-3">Third Language Option</p>
				<p class="basic-text">If a student demonstrates knowledge of two foreign languages at the 102 level, the College of Arts and Sciences may consider waiving two semesters of the four semester College Distribution Requirements Area 5 languages requirement. If this waiver were granted, the student would then be required to complete 101 and 102 in another (3rd language) at UNL.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Minimum Hours Required for Graduation</p>
				<p class="basic-text">A minimum of 120 semester hours of credit is required for graduation from the College of Arts and Sciences. A total grade point average of at least 2.0 is required.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Grade Rules </p>
				<p class="title-2">Restrictions on C- and D Grades</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The College will accept no more than 15 semester hours of C- and D grades from other schools except for UNO and UNK. No transfer C- and D grades can be applied toward requirements in a major or a minor. No UNL C- and D grades can be applied toward requirements in a major or a minor.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Pass/No Pass Privilege</p>
				<p class="basic-text">University regulations for the Pass/No Pass (P/N) privilege state:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">The Pass/No Pass option is designed for your use by seeking to expand your intellectual horizons by taking courses in areas where you may have had minimal preparation.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">For students in Arts and Sciences, the University regulations for Pass/No Pass apply as follows:</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="numbered-list">1. Neither the P nor the N grade contribute to your GPA.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">2. P is interpreted to mean C or above.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">3. A change to or from a Pass/No Pass may be made until mid-term (1/2 of the course).</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">4. The Pass/No Pass or grade registration cannot conflict with the policy of the professor, department, college, or University governing the grading option.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">5. Changing to or from Pass/No Pass requires using the MyRED system to change the grading option or filing a Drop/Add form with the the Office of the University Registrar, 107 Canfield Administration Building. After mid-term of the course, a student registered for Pass/No Pass cannot change to a grade registration unless the Pass/No Pass registration is in conflict with the policy of the professor, department, college, or University governing Pass/No Pass. The Pass/No Pass grading option is not available to students on academic probation unless the course is offered only on a Pass/No Pass basis.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">6. The Pass/No Pass grading option cannot be used for the removal of C- or D or F grades.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Pass/No Pass privileges in the College of Arts and Sciences are extended to students according to the following additional regulations:</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">1. Pass/No Pass hours can count toward fulfillment of University ACE requirements and college distribution requirements up to the 24-hour maximum.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">2. Many Arts and Sciences departments and programs do not allow courses in the major or minor to be taken Pass/No Pass; students should refer to the department’s or program’s section of the bulletin for clarification. By college rule, departments can allow up to 6 hours of Pass/No Pass in the major or minor.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">3. Freshmen and sophomores may enroll for no more than 6 hours of P/N work per semester.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">4. Departments may specify that certain courses of theirs can be taken only on a P/N basis.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">5. The college will permit no more than a total of 24 semester hours of P/N grades to be applied toward degree requirements. This total includes all Pass grades earned at UNL and other U.S. schools. <span class="basic-text-bold">NOTE:</span> This 24-hour limit is more restrictive than the University regulation.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph">Students who wish to apply P/N hours to their major and minor(s) must obtain approval on a form that is available in the Arts and Sciences Advising Center, 107 Oldfather Hall.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Grading Appeals</p>
				<p class="basic-text">A student who feels that he/she has been unfairly graded must ordinarily take the following sequential steps in a timely manner, usually by initiating the appeal in the semester following the awarding of the grade:</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">1. Talk with the instructor concerned. Most problems are resolved at this point.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">2. Talk to the instructor’s department chairperson.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">3. Take the case to the Grading Appeal Committee of the department concerned. The Committee should be contacted through the department chairperson.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">4. Take the case to the College Grading Appeals Committee by contacting the Dean’s Office, 1223 Oldfather Hall.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Course Level Requirements</p>
				<p class="title-2">Courses Numbered above 299</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Thirty of the 120 semester hours of credit must be in courses numbered above 299. Of the 30 hours above 299, 15 hours (1/2) must be completed in residence at UNL. <span class="basic-text-bold">NOTE:</span> ALEC 397E and ALEC 397K do not count toward these 30 hours.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Graduate Courses</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Seniors in the University who have obtained in advance the approval of the dean for Graduate Studies may receive up to 12 hours credit for graduate courses taken in addition to the courses necessary to complete their undergraduate work, provided that such credits are earned within the calendar year prior to receipt of the baccalaureate. For procedures, inquire at the Office of Graduate Studies.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Course work taken prior to receipt of the baccalaureate may not always be accepted for transfer to other institutions as graduate work.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Residency</p>
				<p class="title-2">Residency Requirement and Open Enrollment and Summer Independent Study Courses</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students must complete at least 30 of the 120 total hours for their degree at UNL. Students must complete at least 1/2 of their major course work including 6 hours above 299 in their major, and 15 of the 30 hours required above 299 in residence. Credit earned during education abroad may be used toward the residency requirement if students register through UNL and participate in prior-approved education abroad programs. UNL open enrollment and summer independent study courses count toward residence.</p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1">DEGREES &amp; MAJORS</p>
				<p class="title-1">Degree Programs and Areas of Study</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The College of Arts and Sciences offers curricula leading to the degrees of bachelor of arts and bachelor of science.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Cross-listed Course Policy</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The College of Arts and Sciences recognizes cross-listed courses as equivalent for the purposes of degree requirements. Therefore, a course taken under one department which is cross-listed can be used in all the majors and minors affected by all the cross-listings of the course.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Requirements for the Bachelor of Arts Degree</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students who wish to graduate with a bachelor of arts degree must complete the College graduation requirements, the University ACE requirements, the College of Arts and Sciences distribution requirements, the requirements for a major, and the requirements for a minor or minors if required by the major.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Requirements for the Bachelor of Science Degree</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The bachelor of science degree is characterized by a strong prescriptive major, an essential scientific base, and the inclusion of a general liberal education as an important aspect of the degree. Requirements for the BS are the same as those for the BA, with the following exceptions:</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">1. The major must include between 50-70 credit hours including required collateral courses in other departments. For students who wish to acquire two majors in two departments, the departments will be asked to make some accommodation for the students.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">2. In addition to the College of Arts and Sciences distribution requirements, the bachelor of science degree requires students to complete 60 semester hours in the natural and mathematical sciences. (See scientific base information under College General Education Requirements.)</p>
				<p class="title-2">Areas of Study for the Major</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students are advised to choose a major before the end of the sophomore year to avoid extending the period of time necessary to complete the degree. By gaining a deeper knowledge of one field, the student will further his or her general liberal education, prepare for a career in his or her specialization, and possibly advance to graduate work or a professional program. It is sometimes possible, through careful planning, for students to complete more than one undergraduate major. Students should consult their advisers about this possibility. The student who majors in more than one field will be assigned to an adviser in each field.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">If a student receives a grade lower than C in a course in his or her chosen major, it will not count toward the major.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students must complete at least 1/2 of the course work in their chosen major field in residence including 6 hours above 299, regardless of the number of hours transferred.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Areas of Study</p>
