				<p class="content-box-m-p"><span class="generated-style">ADMISSION</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">College Admission Requirements</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students accepted by the University must have an ACT of 20 or SAT of 950, or rank in the upper half of their high school graduating class, and have the following high school preparation to be eligible for guaranteed admission to the College of Education and Human Sciences:</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Four years of English that include intensive reading and writing experience; </span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Two years of one foreign language;</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Four years of mathematics, that include Algebra I, II, geometry and one year that builds on a knowledge of algebra;</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Three years of natural sciences that include at least two years selected from biology, physics, chemistry, and earth science and one year of laboratory instruction;</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Three years of social studies, that include at least one year of American and/or world history and one year of history, American government, and/or geography.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Transfer and Readmitted Student Requirements</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Transfer students from universities or colleges outside of UNL and readmitted students seeking admission to the College of Education and Human Sciences must have an accumulated average of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale or above and no high school deficiencies. Students who do not meet these requirements must enroll as deciding students in the Division of General Studies or in another college. Once they have completed 12 graded hours at UNL with a minimum 2.0 grade point average, and have removed any high school deficiencies, UNL students may apply for admission to the College.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Transfer and readmitted students must meet the graduation requirements for the College of Education and Human Sciences as stated in the current catalog in effect at the time they enter or reenter the College.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students who left the College on probation, or who were dismissed, may seek readmission to the College after two semesters by applying to the UNL Admissions Office. Readmission is not assured. However, the admissions committee is receptive to giving students a second opportunity to be successful. The committee is interested in knowing what the student has done in the intervening period that would suggest the student will be successful when readmitted. Successfully completing correspondence courses and/or community college courses is an effective way to demonstrate one’s commitment to academic success.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Transferring from Other Colleges at UNL</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students transferring to the College of Education and Human Sciences from another University of Nebraska–Lincoln college or from the Division of General Studies must have a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0, be in good academic standing, and meet the freshman entrance requirements that exist at the time of their admission to the College of Education and Human Sciences. </span><span class="basic-text-bold">Students must fulfill degree requirements that exist at the time of their admission to the college, not at the time they enter UNL.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">To remain current, College of Education and Human Sciences students must enroll in, and complete, at least one UNL course that will apply toward degree requirements during a 12 month period. Students who readmit following an absence of one year or more must meet all requirements in the Undergraduate Bulletin in effect at the time of readmission and enrollment. Students who transfer to another UNL college and later return to the College of Education and Human Sciences will be considered readmitted students. Students who transfer out of a teacher education program, but who continue their certification program while seeking a degree in another UNL college, are exempt from this policy.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">International Students</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The College of Education and Human Sciences welcomes undergraduate international students. As a part of admission to the College, international students must present a TOEFL score of 550 or higher and TSE score of 230 or higher.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students seeking teacher education and state certification must meet the same requirements as any other undergraduate students, including the Pre-Professional Skills Test or other basic skills test approved by the Nebraska Department of Education. Students who have received a degree outside of the United States and are interested in teacher certification are required to have a transcript review completed by an approved agency not directly associated with the University of Nebraska. For more information, please contact the Student Services Center.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Removal of Deficiencies</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students admitted to the University with high school deficiencies are expected to clear up those deficiencies in a timely manner. Students with deficiencies are not eligible for graduation. Students pursuing teaching credentials may use courses to clear admissions deficiencies and towards meeting ACE requirements as well as graduation requirements. Students having majors listed under the Human Sciences, may NOT double count a class to meet both deficiency removal and graduation requirements. The Dean of the College of Education and Human Sciences will make the final decision concerning any problems or questions that may arise in satisfying requirements to remove deficiencies.</span></p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1"><span class="generated-style">ADVISING</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Registration for Classes and Advising Tips</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">College of Education and Human Sciences students are encouraged to meet with their assigned academic adviser prior to registration for any term (fall, spring, and summer session). Every EHS student is assigned to an adviser. If you do not know the name of your academic adviser, please call the advising center at 402-472-8625 or drop-by 105 Henzlik Hall. </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The College of Education and Human Sciences Student Services Center is staffed with professional advisers who assist students with assessing educational goals, planning programs of study, understanding program requirements and knowing policies and procedures. As course selection and registration are critical to the timely completion of their academic goals, students are well advised to seek regular academic counseling from their assigned advisers in the Center to obtain the most up-to-date information regarding current requirements and timely completion of degree programs.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The Center is also staffed with professionals to coordinate field placements, student teaching, and teaching certificate application.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Ultimately, students are themselves responsible for fulfilling all the requirements of the curriculum in which they are enrolled. The intellectual mentoring relationship between academic adviser and student is protected by confidentiality and strengthened by listening with understanding to student concerns. A student remains with an adviser for the duration of the educational program unless the student changes his/her program of study.</span></p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1"><span class="generated-style">ACADEMIC PROGRAMS &amp; POLICIES</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Academic Load</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">A maximum of 18 credit hours may be taken each semester (up to 4 hours in the Pre-Session; up to 7 in each five-week session; up to 9 in the eight-week session) without special authorization from the Director of Advising. UNL students must be enrolled in 12 hours in a semester to be considered full time. Most first-year students are advised to take no more than 12-15 credit hours in the first semester. This allows new students to make an easier transition from high school to college study. Most students require 2-3 hours of preparation for every hour in class, so a schedule of 12 credit hours is actually equivalent to a 36-48 hour a week job.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Outside work may interfere with academic success. The student who must work should plan to take a lighter load and consider taking some summer sessions or an extra semester or two to complete the work required for a degree. </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students should check if restrictions on the number of graded hours each term govern their continued eligibility for medical/auto insurance, scholarships, and/or financial aid.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Credit Rules</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Credit by Exam</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students who believe that previous experience satisfies course requirements may approach the appropriate academic department for possible credit by exam options. Credit is rarely given simply for work experience. </span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Dual Degrees</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students in the College of Education and Human Sciences may earn a bachelor of science degree from the College of Education and Human Sciences and a bachelor of science degree from another UNL college. Students must complete the degree requirements for both colleges and a minimum of 30 credit hours beyond their primary college.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Student Recognition</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Dean’s List</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">A Dean’s List of Education and Human Sciences and dual matriculated students who meet the stated criteria is published in the fall and spring semesters. To be eligible, students must have a minimum semester grade point average of 3.75 in 12 or more graded semester hours. Exceptions are made for students taking required courses offered only on a Pass/No Pass basis.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Student teachers and practica students who either (1) enter the semester of student teaching with a cumulative GPA of 3.75 or above, or (2) earn a 3.75 GPA during the preceding semester on the basis of 12 or more graded semester hours, will be eligible for the Dean’s List with recommendation from the University supervisor.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Post-baccalaureate students working on certifications are eligible upon request to the Director of Advising, but only undergraduate hours apply.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Degrees with Distinction</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">In recognition of outstanding academic excellence, the College of Education and Human Sciences recommends the bachelors degree With Distinction, With High Distinction and With Highest Distinction. All students graduating with distinction must meet the following criteria:</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Candidates must have completed at least 60 hours at UNL (Child, Youth and Family Studies students enrolled at UNO) by the time of graduation.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Persons in teaching endorsement programs must satisfactorily complete student teaching; persons in non-endorsement programs must satisfactorily fulfill practica or other internship experiences as required by their programs of study.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Eligibility is based on the cumulative grade point average of all credit hours taken at UNL (UNO) prior to the beginning of the term in which the student receives his or her degree.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Highest Distinction.</span><span class="generated-style"> Candidates for the bachelors degree who have successfully completed the program to which they were admitted and achieved a 4.0 cumulative grade point average.</span></p>

				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Undergraduate Scholarships and Fellowships</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">In addition to the scholarships awarded by the University, the College of Education and Human Sciences awards a number of scholarships funded by various donors—individuals, organizations and foundations. Criteria for awarding these scholarships vary to meet the wishes of the donors but often include financial need, academic performance, major area of study and class standing.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Scholarships which vary in amount are awarded annually to incoming first time, transfer, and continuing College of Education and Human Sciences students. First-time freshmen need to complete the UNL Application for Admission and the FAFSA. Continuing students should complete, annually, the scholarship application through their MyRED account, and include a resume. Completion of the FAFSA is also recommended. </span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Substitutions and Waivers</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">In rare cases, there may be a need for students to request a special substitution or waiver to curriculum requirements. Such a request is made only in exceptional and unusual circumstances and cannot serve as an excuse for not following correct degree requirements. Specific instructions and procedures are available from students’ academic advisers in the Student Services Center, 105 Henzlik Hall.</span></p>
				<p class="content-box-m-p"><span class="generated-style">ACE REQUIREMENTS</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">All UNL students who are following the 2011-2012 bulletin will be required to complete a minimum of 3 hours of approved course work in each of the 10 designated Achievement Centered Education (ACE) student learning outcome areas which can be viewed at http://ace.unl.edu. Students will be provided a list of classes they can select from to meet each of the 10 ACE Student Learning Outcomes. It is highly recommended that students contact their adviser prior to registering for ACE classes in order to insure that each of the class selections are in the best interest of the students’ academic program.</span></p>

				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Acceptance of Transfer Grades</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Grades earned at UNL, UNO, UNK</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Grades of D-, D, D+, and C- satisfy requirements in all programs in the College unless specified otherwise. Students who receive a grade of D-, D, D+, C-, however, are encouraged to retake the course.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Grades earned outside the University of Nebraska system</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The college will accept no more than 9 credit hours of grades less than a C from any program outside the University of Nebraska system. Grades below a C can only be applied to general education requirements and elective classes.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Maximum Number of Hours for Transfer</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Transfer courses are evaluated by the University and the College to determine UNL and College course equivalencies. The College determines which courses will be accepted and how they will apply toward degree requirements. Sixty-six (66) is the maximum number of hours that will be accepted on transfer from a two-year college. Ninety-five (95) is the maximum number of hours that will be accepted on transfer from accredited four-year colleges and universities.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Courses taken 10 years before admission or readmission to the College will be evaluated by the major department to determine if it is appropriate to accept those courses for transfer and application to degree requirements. Specific courses will be reviewed in keeping with the guidelines specified by each department.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Transfer Credit from Technical, Non-Accredited and Foreign Institutions</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students who desire to transfer from these institutions must have each course evaluated by the appropriate departmental representative. All rules stated above in reference to grades and maximum credit hours apply. For additional information and guidance in this process contact the Dean’s Office.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Transfer Agreements with UNO and UNK</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Transfer agreements between the three institutions within the University System allow for a smooth transition for students interested in taking courses from UNO, UNK, and/or UNL. Although restrictions noted above on grades and maximum transfer hours still apply, there are some exceptions. For purposes of residency, courses from UNO and UNK fulfill these requirements. Students planning to major in a program in the college should read the specific requirements noted with individual programs. Questions about academic transfer should be addressed to the Advising Office.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Transfer Agreements with Community Colleges</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Articulation agreements and “Transfer with Ease Programs” with Nebraska community colleges indicate how courses and programs will transfer to UNL and the College of Education and Human Sciences.
