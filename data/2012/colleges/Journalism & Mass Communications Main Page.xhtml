				<p class="faculty-list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">Gary Kebbel, </span><span class="generated-style">M.A., M.S.W., M.A., Dean and Professor of Journalism, 402-472-3041</span></p>
				<p class="faculty-list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">Charlyne Berens,</span><span class="generated-style"> Ph.D., Associate Dean and Professor of Journalism, 402-472-3041</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Mission/Objectives/Goals</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Our mission is to graduate highly competent professionals who have acquired communication and critical thinking skills appropriate to journalism and to advertising and public relations. We hold true to the core principles of journalism and mass communication education and as leaders of the digital communications environment. Our mission is grounded in the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, which gives us a unique responsibility to serve the needs of a diverse society. Through excellence in teaching and research, we educate ethical, socially responsible, well-rounded and fair-minded graduates who will carry those traits into the real world.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Administrative Structure</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The college includes two sequences—advertising and journalism—in which students may major in advertising and public relations, broadcasting, or journalism.</span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">Undergraduate Majors</span></p>
				<p class="list-indent"><span class="generated-style">Advertising and Public Relations </span></p>
				<p class="list-indent"><span class="generated-style">Broadcasting </span></p>

				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Faculty</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Quality undergraduate teaching is a source of pride in the College of Journalism and Mass Communications. Most classes are small, and faculty members are known for the individual attention they give to their students. Faculty have a wealth of experience in the communications professions: as advertising and public relations managers, writers and designers for advertising and public relations agencies, newspapers and broadcasting outlets; as writers, producers and on-air talent for radio and television; and as reporters, editors and photographers at newspapers and magazines.</span></p>
				<p class="content-box-m-p"><span class="generated-style">ADMISSION</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">College Admission</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The entrance requirements for the College of Journalism and Mass Communications are the same as the admission requirements for the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">These include: </span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">English (4 units)</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Mathematics (4 units)</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Social studies (3 units)</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Natural sciences (3 units), and</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Foreign language (2 units). </span></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">One unit equals one year of high school credit. Students with one deficiency, two deficiencies but not in the same category, or two deficiencies in foreign language who receive a Deferred Admission or Admission by Review, may be considered for admission to the college. Students who are admitted through the Admission by Review process with core course deficiencies will have certain conditions attached to their enrollment at UNL. These conditions are explained under Admission to the University, Removal of Deficiencies. High school deficiencies must be removed during the first 30 credit hours of enrollment at UNL (60 hours for foreign language) or the first calendar year, whichever takes longer.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Admission Deficiency Information </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="basic-text-bold">The college’s policy regarding acceptance of credit for courses taken to remove admission deficiencies is that those credit hours will count toward ACE and elective credit (Group L of the non-major requirements) only.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Admission GPA</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Any student transferring into the college must have at least a 2.0 GPA. A student with 12 or more hours of college credit must have at least a 2.0 GPA to be admitted or readmitted to the College of Journalism and Mass Communications.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Readmission</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">A student who left the University not in good standing (below a 2.0 grade point average), may be readmitted in the Division of General Studies. Such a student would be eligible to reenter the College of Journalism and Mass Communications upon attaining a 2.0 cumulative GPA. This student would follow the bulletin in effect at the time of the transfer from General Studies to the college.</span></p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1"><span class="generated-style">Other Admission Requirements</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Students from Other Colleges </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">College of Journalism and Mass Communications courses will be restricted to College of Journalism and Mass Communications majors except where stipulated differently. Students from colleges and departments with a written agreement with the College of Journalism and Mass Communications will be exempt from this policy. Permission may be granted by the dean of the College of Journalism and Mass Communications in special circumstances following the directives provided by the faculty in these matters.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">ESL Students</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Applicants who speak English as a second language must present a TOEFL score of 600 or higher. Additionally, broadcasting majors must present a score of at least 45 on the Test of Spoken English.</span></p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1"><span class="generated-style">ADVISING</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Academic Advising</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Upon enrollment in the college, each student is assigned to a faculty adviser. The student is expected to consult with his or her adviser each semester before registering for the next semester’s courses.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Although the faculty advisers seek to assist students in the selection of courses leading toward graduation, the final decision regarding which courses are taken is ultimately the student’s. Therefore, students are responsible for identifying and enrolling in those courses that will lead to completion of all published degree requirements.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">In addition, each first-year student and each senior should see the college’s advising coordinator, 105 Andersen Hall, to make sure all college and university requirements are completed.</span></p>

				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Credit by Examination</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Through study or experience that parallels a University of Nebraska-Lincoln course, a regularly enrolled university student may feel prepared to pass an examination on the course content for course credit. To apply for credit, a student should: </span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">1. Pick up a credit-by-examination form at the Information Window, Office of Registration and Records, 107 Canfield Administration Building; </span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">2. Secure the approval signature of the dean of the college; </span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">3. Have the Credentials Office verify that he or she is currently enrolled; </span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">4. Secure the Bursar’s Receipt for Payment of the examination fee; and </span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">5. Present the completed form to the instructor designated by the dean’s office.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The instructor will then give the examination and report the results to the Office of Registration and Records through the dean of the college. A student is not permitted to receive credit by examination in a course that is a prerequisite for one in which he or she already has received credit.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The College of Journalism and Mass Communications also gives credit for the subject and general examinations of the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) administered by the College Entrance Examination Board. Inquire in 107 Canfield Administration Building for the current policy regarding CLEP examinations.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Grade Appeals</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The following is a synopsis of the College of Journalism and Mass Communications grade appeals policy. The policy is designed to provide students with protection through orderly procedures against prejudiced or capricious academic evaluation. A student with a concern about a grade should take the following steps:</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">1. Talk with the instructor involved. Many problems are resolved at this level.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">2. Talk with an assistant or associate dean in 147 Andersen Hall.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">3. If the foregoing steps have not resulted in a solution, arrange to take the problem to the sequence grading appeals committee. This step involves presenting the problem in writing.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">4. If an appeal from the sequence committee is necessary, arrange to take the appeal to the College Grading Appeals Committee.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Student Recognition</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Honors and Awards</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Outstanding students are honored each spring during an honors convocation. The college recognizes students whose cumulative grade point averages place them in the top 10 percent of their respective classes, students who hold scholarships and students who have earned special awards.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">In addition, the college distributes a semester dean’s list. To be included on the semester dean’s list, a student must have earned at least a 3.7 semester GPA on 12 or more graded hours.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Kappa Tau Alpha.</span><span class="generated-style"> The Will Owen Jones Chapter of Kappa Tau Alpha, the national journalism honorary, recognizes outstanding undergraduate and graduate students. Membership is limited to those in the top 10 percent of the junior and senior classes in the College of Journalism and Mass Communications who have completed the junior level professional courses. Each year the society honors a student achieving the highest four-year grade point average in the college and presents an award to the Distinguished Journalist of the Year.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Alpha Delta Sigma.</span><span class="generated-style"> As the only national honorary society for advertising students, ADS recognizes outstanding academic achievement. Since ADS was initiated in 1976, students nominated by their faculty advisers have been elected by division leaders into this exclusive scholastic group. An ADS chapter was founded at UNL in 1993. To be eligible for nomination, students must be enrolled in the local American Advertising Federation chapter (Ad Club).</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Alpha Epsilon Rho.</span><span class="generated-style"> Alpha Epsilon Rho recognizes superior scholarship in the field of broadcasting. The University of Nebraska chapter was chartered in 1946. Membership is by invitation upon completion of 9 hours in broadcasting with a cumulative grade of 3.25 in broadcasting and 3.0 cumulative or above. For more information, contact the college office in 147 Andersen Hall.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Degrees With Distinction</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">In recognition of academic excellence, the college recommends the bachelors degree with distinction, with high distinction and with highest distinction. To be recommended, candidates must fulfill the specific criteria as described below, in addition to meeting all the general criteria and procedures applicable to all distinction classifications. The thesis and results of the examination over the thesis in each instance must be acceptable to the advisory committee.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Highest Distinction.</span><span class="generated-style"> Candidates for the bachelors degree may be recommended for degrees with highest distinction on the basis of the following criteria: scholastic standing within the top 5 percent of the graduating class of the college in the preceding 12-month period and the advisory committee’s recommendation based upon a thesis or comparable creative effort and an oral examination over that thesis or creative effort.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">High Distinction.</span><span class="generated-style"> Candidates for the bachelors degree may be recommended for degrees with high distinction by fulfilling one of two sets of criteria: 1) by achieving scholastic standing within the top 5 percent of the graduating class of the college in the preceding 12-month period; or 2) by achieving scholastic standing within the top 10 percent of the graduating class of the college in the preceding 12-month period and by recommendation of the advisory committee based on a thesis or comparable creative effort and an oral examination over that thesis or creative effort.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Distinction.</span><span class="generated-style"> Candidates for the bachelors degree may be recommended for degrees with distinction by achieving one of two sets of criteria: 1) by achieving scholastic standing within the top 10 percent of the graduating class of the college in the preceding 12-month period; or 2) by achieving scholastic standing within the top 15 percent of the graduating class (never below a 3.7 GPA) of the college for the preceding 12-month period and by recommendation of the college’s advisory committee based upon a thesis or comparable creative effort and an oral examination over that thesis or creative effort.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">The following criteria apply to all categories:</span><span class="generated-style"> Ordinarily, only students who have taken their last 48 hours of course work in residence will be considered for degrees with distinction. In considering individual cases, the advisory committee will review both grades and the program of courses. Students who choose one of the thesis options described above should make arrangements before their senior year by consulting with their academic advisers. These students must register for ADPR 499H or JOUR 499H for one hour of credit in the semester they plan to complete the thesis proposal and register for an additional two hours of credit in the semester they plan to complete the thesis. At least two members of the student’s honors thesis committee must make a recommendation to the advisory committee on the thesis work.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">During the semester before the student intends to graduate, she or he should visit the dean’s office in Andersen Hall to obtain the schedule of deadline dates for submission of reports of examining committees. The forms for making the reports are also available in the dean’s office.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Scholarships</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Each year the college awards more than 100 scholarships worth more than $178,000. Most scholarships go to upperclassmen, although a limited number are awarded to freshmen.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">College scholarship information is available on-line at the college’s Web site, www.unl.edu/journalism/students/undergrad/scholarships.shtml. The forms must be completed and returned to the dean’s office by March 1. Awards are made in April.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Entering freshmen must apply through the university’s Admissions Office in the Van Brunt Visitor Center, 313 N. 13th Street. Additional applications and letters of explanation may be sent to the college at the following address:</span></p>

				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Senior Check/Degree Audit</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">It is no longer necessary to request a “senior check.” Graduation Services, 109 Canfield Administration Building, automatically mails a letter and degree audit to each senior to identify any unfulfilled requirements in the student’s academic program.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">With each term’s registration, students should determine how course selections apply to requirements by obtaining a degree audit, available at the MyRED link on http://www.unl.edu.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students should print their degree audits and take them to the meetings with their advisers. Because the Web-based degree audit system loads overnight, one can examine a new audit no sooner than one day after registering for classes.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Application for Degree</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Each student who expects to receive a diploma must file an application for candidacy for the diploma and pay a $25 fee to Graduation Services, 109 Canfield Administration Building. Announcements about deadline dates are published and posted on bulletin boards around campus.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students are responsible for informing Graduation Services of their graduation plans, including their addresses, the manner in which they are completing their requirements, such as by correspondence, by clearance of incompletes, by enrollment at another institution, by taking special examinations, etc., and of any later revision of such plans. Failure to follow this procedure may cause postponement of graduation until a later semester.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The first semester during which the transcript indicates a student is a journalism major establishes the semester in which he or she is considered to have entered the college.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Student Standing/Classification</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Sophomore Standing.</span><span class="generated-style"> For admission to sophomore standing a student must have completed a minimum of 27 semester hours of credit and attained a total grade point average of at least C.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Junior Standing.</span><span class="generated-style"> A student has junior standing after meeting the requirements for sophomore standing and completing 53 semester hours of credit.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Senior Standing.</span><span class="generated-style"> A student has senior standing after meeting the requirements for junior standing and completing 89 semester hours of credit.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Waivers/Substitutions</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The college will allow no waivers for graduation requirements. If students think they have met the intent of a particular requirement in some other fashion, they may submit a substitution request form.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The form requires students to justify the request and secure recommendations from their advisers. Students must submit completed requests, with appropriate recommendations, to the dean’s office no later than two working days prior to the next regularly scheduled meeting of the College Executive Committee. Decisions to grant or deny requests will be made by that committee or a designated subcommittee; appeals will go to the full faculty.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students must remember that it is their responsibility to know and follow the graduation requirements of the college. A substitution request should come only after all other avenues of advising and course work have been exhausted.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The faculty will consider only substitutions. Under no circumstances will requirements be waived. A substitution shall be defined as:</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">1. The replacement of a required course by a course of very similar content.</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">2. Credit by examination when offered.</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">3. The replacement of a required course with significant professional experience. This will be allowed only in rare instances. The experience will substitute only for course content, not for credit hours. Additional credit hours may be needed to maintain minimum credit hour requirements for graduation.</span></p>
				<p class="content-box-m-p"><span class="generated-style">ACE REQUIREMENTS</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">All students must fulfill the Achievement Centered Education (ACE) requirements. Information about the ACE program may be viewed at ace.unl.edu.</span></p>

				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students who left the university in good standing may be readmitted in the College of Journalism and Mass Communications, and they may choose the bulletin under which they wish to graduate according to the following guidelines:</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">1. Students must fulfill the requirements stated in the Undergraduate Bulletin for the year they enter the College of Journalism and Mass Communications or in any subsequent bulletin published while they are enrolled in the college.</span></p>

A major of 24 or more hours may take the place of a 24-hour concentration. At least one of these options must be from one of the liberal arts departments, and all of these options must be from outside the College of Journalism and Mass Communications.<br /> The College recognizes cross-listed courses as equivalent for the purposes of degree requirements. However, a course taken under one department that is cross-listed cannot be applied in all the majors and minors affected by all the cross-listings of the course until at least 36 hours of course work have been recorded in the concentration requirement. Once 36 discrete hours are applied to Group K, courses may count in more than one concentration. Hybrid concentrations in fine arts and business are shown in the separate major pages.</span></p>

This limitation on fine arts, communication studies and other areas outside the College of Journalism and Mass Communications does not apply to students completing designated majors or minors in those areas. This means that a student who has declared a designated major or minor or concentration in any of these areas has no performance limit applied to the degree audit.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Majors</span></p>
