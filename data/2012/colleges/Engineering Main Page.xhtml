This minor has four components:</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">1. Twelve (12) credit hours of courses in international engineering and related courses.<br /> The courses must be chosen from the list of courses maintained by the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and the College Office of International Programs. The course list includes all sections of ENGR 490 and MODL 98 and the list of courses included in Appendix 1. In addition,</span></p>
				<p class="bullet-2"><span class="generated-style">a. A minimum of 3 credit hours must be in ENGR 490 courses.</span></p>
				<p class="bullet-2"><span class="generated-style">b. A minimum of 6 credit hours must be in 300-level courses or above.</span></p>
				<p class="bullet-2"><span class="generated-style">c. A maximum of 6 credit hours may be taken Pass/No Pass.</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">2. Two (2) semesters with a minimum of 6 credit hours of college-level foreign language.<br /> The actual number of credit hours taken will depend on the specific courses taken by the student.</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">3. Participation in a study abroad experience in a program approved by the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and the College Office of International Programs.</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">4. A minimum of 9 credit hours of the course work listed for this minor cannot count toward the undergraduate engineering degree or the master of architectural engineering degree.</span></p>
				<p class="content-box-m-p"><span class="generated-style">OTHER</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Professional Licensure</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The College encourages professional licensure. The majority of the College’s engineering seniors take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) examination prior to graduation. This examination is administered by the Nebraska Board of Engineers and Architects, a state agency, and the first step in the process of becoming a licensed professional engineer. To become a licensed professional engineer, one must pass the FE exam, have four years of experience, and pass a professional practice examination. Students may take the FE exam in the last semester of their baccalaureate program.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Accreditation</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The agricultural engineering, biological systems engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering (Lincoln and Omaha campuses), computer engineering (Lincoln and Omaha campus), electrical engineering, electronics engineering, industrial engineering, and mechanical engineering programs are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), http://www.abet.org.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The master of architectural engineering is also accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), http://www.abet.org. </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The construction management program is accredited by the American Council for Construction Education.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Scholarships and Financial Aid</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Each year the College awards scholarships to freshmen and upperclassmen worth more than $750,000. Scholarship awards are made possible through generous gifts of alumni and friends, local and national organizations, and through funding by the Nebraska Legislature. Contact the Office of the Dean or the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid for information regarding these awards and for other financial assistance.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Application for UNL freshmen scholarships automatically makes you eligible for College of Engineering scholarships as well as other university awards such as the Regents and David scholarships. You must submit the UNL Application form (due January 15, prior to the beginning of the next academic year) to be eligible.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">A significant number of entering students have academic records that qualify them for university-wide scholarship awards. Each year about 25 percent of the freshman Regent Scholarship recipients are engineering students.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">A large number of students are able to find part-time employment in fields related to their interests.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Student Organizations in the College</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Technical Societies</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The technical student societies help develop a greater personal and professional interest and understanding in engineering, computer science and construction management. Student branches of the major national technical and scientific societies are sponsored by the academic programs and departments.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Lincoln Campus.</span><span class="generated-style"> American Institute of Chemical Engineers; The Society for Engineering in Agricultural, Food, and Biological Systems; American Society of Civil Engineers; American Society of Mechanical Engineers; Associated General Contractors; Association for Computer Machinery; Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers; Institute of Industrial Engineers; American Society for Metals; Student Advisory Board; Institute of Transportation Engineers; National Society of Black Engineers; Society of American Military Engineers; Society of Women Engineers; and Society of Automotive Engineers.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Lifelong Learning</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The education of professionals in construction management, engineering, and engineering technology is a continuing process. The groundwork in both technical and nontechnical studies is laid while in college, but education continues after graduation. For a professional, education continues in the technical and in the human and social concerns areas, and may expect to take a leadership role in the community, have a broad awareness of human and social accomplishments, needs, values, and a willingness to take the responsibility for meeting these needs. For these reasons, an integrated program of course work in the humanities and social sciences is a part of the educational requirements.</span></p>
