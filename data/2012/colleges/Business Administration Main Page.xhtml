				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The University of Nebraska–Lincoln and the College of Business Administration are committed to providing effective academic advising to students.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Academic advisers are available to assist students in assessing educational goals, planning programs of study, understanding program requirements, and following policies and procedures. </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students are ultimately responsible for fulfilling all the requirements of the curriculum in which they are enrolled. </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students are responsible for initiating advising contacts and preparing for advising sessions. </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The mentoring relationship between academic advisers and students is confidential and is strengthened by advisers’ listening with understanding to student concerns. </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students are expected to take responsibility for a successful university experience and effective advising session. For this to occur the student must:</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Participate in New Student Enrollment, priority registration programs, and any other University/College programs designed to enhance the student-life experience.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Review DARS (Degree Audit Report) each semester and each time you make a change to your schedule. Schedule appointments with advisers well in advance of priority registration and at other times as needed. Keep appointments and be punctual, or call to reschedule if necessary.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Read the appropriate sections of the Undergraduate Bulletin.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Identify specific questions to address prior to meeting with an adviser and be prepared to do long-term planning.</span></li>

					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">A minimum of 12 credit hours must be taken each semester to remain a full time student.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">To complete the requirements for a degree in eight semesters, a student must earn an average of 15 credit hours each semester. Most students need a minimum of two hours of preparation for every hour in class, so a schedule of 15 credit hours is actually equivalent to a 45 hour a week job (15 classroom + 30 preparation).</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The student who must work or one who may need additional study time, should plan to take a lighter load and consider taking some summer sessions or an extra semester or two to complete the work required for a degree. In the event that a student’s cumulative grade point average falls below 2.5, a lighter academic load may be required.</span></p>

Any exceptions to the rules (substitutions and/or waivers) are made as a written appeal to the faculty through the Academic Planning Committee of the College.

				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Grade Appeal</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students who believe they have received an unfair grade may take the following sequential actions to appeal a grade:</span></p>

					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">The student must discuss the situation with the instructor involved.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">If no acceptable solution is reached, the student may file a written grade appeal with the Grade Appeal Committee of the specific department or school in the College within the first 20 days of the academic semester following receipt of the course grade. In making his or her appeal, the student must allege that the guarantees contained in Section II, Part B, of the Student in the Academic Community, have been violated. The Committee may be contacted through the department chair or school director.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">If either the instructor or the student disagrees with the decision of the Grade Appeal Committee, a written appeal may be filed with the Collegiate Grade Appeals Committee, which may be contacted through the Dean’s Office for Undergraduate Programs.</span></li>

				<p class="content-box-m-p"><span class="generated-style">ACE REQUIREMENTS</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">All students must fulfill the Achievement Centered Education (ACE) requirements. Information about the ACE program may be viewed at ace.unl.edu.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">ACE Achievement-Centered Education—Ten Courses (normally 30 hours)</span></p>

					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">ACE SLO’s must be satisfied by work in at least three subject areas;</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">No ACE course may satisfy more than one ACE SLO in a student’s program;</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">If an ACE course addresses two ACE SLO’s, the student decides which one of the two outcomes the course will satisfy in that student’s program. (The degree audit will make an automatic decision based on first course taken; first SLO needed.)</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">As part of the college requirements of non-business and business courses, many courses will also work for ACE. Students should carefully review required course work with ACE options to make the best use of courses to fulfill both degree requirements as well as UNL ACE requirements.</span></li>
