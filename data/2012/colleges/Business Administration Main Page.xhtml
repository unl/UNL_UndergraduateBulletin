				<p class="title-2">Dean’s Office for Undergraduate Programs</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students are encouraged to obtain information and advice through the Dean’s Office for Undergraduate Programs, CBA 114.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The staff, which includes both professional staff and peer advisers, are well trained, easily accessible, and can provide academic counseling and answer questions on specific degree requirements, transfer credits, prerequisites, changes in major or college, waivers, procedures or policies, and other available campus services.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Professional Staff:</span> Mark Davis, Bede Bolin, Jeff Burdic, Betsy Klemme, Eric Einspahr, D’vee Buss, Megan Friesen</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Career Services.</span> While staff and faculty advisers may assist in career advising, the College works closely with the University’s Career Services Office to provide assistance to CBA students. Students should schedule time each semester to visit with the Career Coaches located in CBA 139. </p>
				<p class="title-1">Student Responsibility </p>
				<p class="basic-text">The University of Nebraska–Lincoln and the College of Business Administration are committed to providing effective academic advising to students.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Academic advisers are available to assist students in assessing educational goals, planning programs of study, understanding program requirements, and following policies and procedures. </p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students are ultimately responsible for fulfilling all the requirements of the curriculum in which they are enrolled. </p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students are responsible for initiating advising contacts and preparing for advising sessions. </p>
				<p class="basic-text">The mentoring relationship between academic advisers and students is confidential and is strengthened by advisers’ listening with understanding to student concerns. </p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students are expected to take responsibility for a successful university experience and effective advising session. For this to occur the student must:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">Participate in New Student Enrollment, priority registration programs, and any other University/College programs designed to enhance the student-life experience.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Review DARS (Degree Audit Report) each semester and each time you make a change to your schedule. Schedule appointments with advisers well in advance of priority registration and at other times as needed. Keep appointments and be punctual, or call to reschedule if necessary.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Read the appropriate sections of the Undergraduate Bulletin.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Identify specific questions to address prior to meeting with an adviser and be prepared to do long-term planning.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Provide honest and accurate information to the adviser regarding any concerns, questions, special needs, deficiencies or barriers that might affect academic success.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Follow academic policies and procedures and meet academic calendar deadlines (e.g. registration, fee payment, degree audit, filing for degree, etc.).</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Know and complete program requirements.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Seek assistance from the various student support services provided by the University and College.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Immediately notify the University of any change in postal address, email address, and/or phone number.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="content-box-h-1">ACADEMIC PROGRAMS &amp; POLICIES</p>
				<p class="title-1">Academic Load</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">A maximum of 19 credit hours (including online and independent study courses through On-line and Distance Education) may be taken each semester without special permission from the Dean’s Office for Undergraduate Programs. The summer sessions have a maximum load of 15 hours. The three week session limit is 3 hours and each five week session has a 7 hour limit.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">A minimum of 12 credit hours must be taken each semester to remain a full time student.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="basic-text">To complete the requirements for a degree in eight semesters, a student must earn an average of 15 credit hours each semester. Most students need a minimum of two hours of preparation for every hour in class, so a schedule of 15 credit hours is actually equivalent to a 45 hour a week job (15 classroom + 30 preparation).</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The student who must work or one who may need additional study time, should plan to take a lighter load and consider taking some summer sessions or an extra semester or two to complete the work required for a degree. In the event that a student’s cumulative grade point average falls below 2.5, a lighter academic load may be required.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Course Exclusions and Restrictions</p>
				<p class="basic-text">No credit for graduation is allowed for non-college level courses or for courses that deal primarily with the development of skills including the following:</p>

				<p class="title-2">Secondary Teaching Certification</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Teaching certification is granted by the Nebraska Department of Education after completing endorsement requirements in one or more approved area(s). A list of approved endorsement areas can be found under “Endorsements” in the College of Education and Human Sciences section. Given the number of elective course options in the business program and with early planning and careful selection, students may integrate the certification requirements with CBA graduation requirements. Students interested in obtaining a teaching certificate should contact the director of the College of Education and Human Sciences Student Services Center, 105 Henzlik Hall.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Honors Program </p>

				<p class="title-1">Student Recognition</p>
				<p class="title-2">Dean’s List/Degrees with Distinction/Scholarships </p>
				<p class="title-3">Dean’s List</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The College recognizes students for academic achievement during the fall and spring semesters by placement on the College Dean’s List. To qualify for the Dean’s List, students must complete 12 or more credit hours for a grade (excluding hours with P, NP, NR and I marks) during the semester and attain a grade point average of 3.6 or higher.</p>
				<p class="title-3">Degrees with Distinction</p>
				<p class="basic-text">In recognition of outstanding academic excellence, the college recommends the bachelors degree <span class="basic-text-ital">With Distinction</span>, <span class="basic-text-ital">With High Distinction</span>, and <span class="basic-text-ital">With Highest Distinction</span>. Students are recommended for this honor by the Scholarship, Honors, and Awards Committee of the College. </p>
				<p class="basic-text">To be eligible for consideration students must:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">complete 45 credit hours for a letter grade (excluding Pass/No Pass marks) at UNL prior to the semester in which they graduate, and </li>
					<li class="bullet-1">must have completed 60 such credit hours at UNL at the time they graduate. </li>
				</ul>
				<p class="basic-text">To determine the level of distinction, the Committee uses the cumulative grade point average based on all credit hours taken at UNL prior to the beginning of the term in which the student receives his or her degree. No specific cumulative grade point average is required but the honor is limited to approximately ten percent of the graduating class. This usually means a 3.8 (or higher) GPA. Students will be notified of the distinction, high, or highest distinction designation approximately one month before graduation.</p>
				<p class="title-1">International Study/Education Abroad</p>
				<p class="title-2">Education Abroad</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The College of Business Administration has several outstanding education abroad programs where students may enroll and complete course work for their degree requirements at a foreign institution or at an international site.

				<p class="title-1">Senior Check/Degree Audit</p>
				<p class="title-2">Degree Audit</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">To be prepared for an on-time graduation, students should continue to monitor their progress through their Degree Audit (DARS), which is a personalized report of degree requirements that can be accessed through MyRED. </li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Each semester, your degree audit will report where courses are being used to fulfill degree requirements, those completed, and courses yet to be taken. Students should check their degree audit each time they change their schedule.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Your degree audit will report the following message “ALL REQUIREMENTS COMPLETED–IN PROGRESS COURSES USED” at the beginning of the intended graduation semester if everything is in order for graduation. </li>
				</ul>
				<p class="title-2">Senior Check</p>
				<p class="basic-text"> In the term after which a student has completed 85 hours, Graduation Services (109 Canfield Administration Building) will perform a “senior check.” Students will be provided with a copy of the degree audit which informs students about requirements that need to be completed to receive the degree.</p>
				<p class="title-3">Graduation Requirements</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">Each student who expects to receive a diploma must have a minimum 2.5 cumulative grade point average to file an application for degree candidacy. </li>
					<li class="bullet-1">At the beginning of the semester in which the student is graduating, the student must file an application for the degree with Graduation Services, 109 Canfield Administration Building. </li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Announcements regarding graduation deadline dates are posted on campus bulletin boards and published in the <span class="basic-text-ital">Daily Nebraskan</span> and the College. DEADLINES ARE EARLY IN THE SEMESTER.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="basic-text">Students are responsible for informing the Office of the University Registrar of the manner in which they are completing their requirements (i.e., by independent study, clearance of incompletes, enrollment at another institution, special examinations, etc.); and of any revision of such plans. In addition, any change in address, email, or phone number should be specifically directed to this office (and updated through MyRED) to avoid a postponement of graduation until a later semester.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Student Standing/Classification</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Second semester freshmen</span> who have completed MATH 104 (or higher) with a grade of “C” or better and have a cumulative 2.5 GPA over at least 14 credit hours earned at UNL, may enroll in ACCT 201 (which normally requires sophomore standing). Freshmen are also permitted to enroll in ECON 211 or ECON 212 upon completion of 12 hours of UNL credit.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Sophomore Standing.</span> For admission to sophomore standing, a student must have earned a minimum of 27 semester hours of credit. It is expected that students will have removed any entrance deficiencies by this point in the program and should maintain a 2.5 cumulative GPA to remain on sequence for graduation.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Junior Standing.</span> A student has junior standing after meeting the requirements for sophomore standing and completing 53 semester hours of credit. It is expected that students will maintain a 2.5 cumulative GPA to remain on sequence for graduation.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Senior Standing.</span> A student has senior standing after meeting the requirements for junior standing and completing 89 semester hours of credit.

				<p class="title-1">Substitutions and Waivers</p>
				<p class="title-2">Curriculum and/or Policy Appeals</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The faculty of the College has established degree requirements and policies and procedures. Any exceptions to the rules (substitutions and/or waivers) are made as a written appeal to the faculty through the Academic Planning Committee of the College. This request can be made only in unusual circumstances and cannot serve as an excuse for not following college guidelines. Students should meet with an adviser in CBA 114 to discuss options, specific instructions, and procedures for consideration of an appeal.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Grade Appeal</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students who believe they have received an unfair grade may take the following sequential actions to appeal a grade:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">The student must discuss the situation with the instructor involved.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">If no acceptable solution is reached, the student may file a written grade appeal with the Grade Appeal Committee of the specific department or school in the College within the first 20 days of the academic semester following receipt of the course grade. In making his or her appeal, the student must allege that the guarantees contained in Section II, Part B, of <span class="basic-text-ital">The Student in the Academic Community</span>, have been violated. The Committee may be contacted through the department chair or school director.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">If either the instructor or the student disagrees with the decision of the Grade Appeal Committee, a written appeal may be filed with the Collegiate Grade Appeals Committee, which may be contacted through the Dean’s Office for Undergraduate Programs.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="title-2">Grade Option Appeal/Late Withdrawal Appeal:</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Appeals to change the grade option in a course after the deadline, as well as any late withdrawal requests must be made in writing to the College Grading and Examinations Committee. Restrictions, options, and forms for either of these procedures may be obtained from the Dean’s Office for Undergraduate Programs, CBA 114. The College generally expects any appeal request to be made within a reasonable time frame.</p>
				<p class="content-box-m-p">ACE REQUIREMENTS</p>
				<p class="basic-text">All students must fulfill the Achievement Centered Education (ACE) requirements. Information about the ACE program may be viewed at ace.unl.edu. Students may also use the Bulletin’s course search facility to search for ACE groups. Example: Enter ACE one in the search to generate a list of all possible ACE 1 courses.</p>
				<p class="title-1">ACE Achievement-Centered Education—Ten Courses (normally 30 hours)</p>
				<p class="basic-text">This is the university’s innovative, outcomes-focused general education component designed to enhance the undergraduate experience by providing broad exposure to multiple disciplines, complementing the major and helping students develop important reasoning, inquiry, and civic capacities.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph">Important rules to remember when selecting course work to meet this requirement:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">There are 10 ACE Student Learning Outcomes (SLO) and at least one course, equivalent to 3 credit hours, must be taken for each of the 10 SLO’s.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Up to three ACE Student Learning Outcomes (SLO), 4-10, may be satisfied by work in one subject area;</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">ACE SLO’s must be satisfied by work in at least three subject areas;</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">No ACE course may satisfy more than one ACE SLO in a student’s program;</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">If an ACE course addresses two ACE SLO’s, the student decides which one of the two outcomes the course will satisfy in that student’s program. (The degree audit will make an automatic decision based on first course taken; first SLO needed.)</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">As part of the college requirements of non-business and business courses, many courses will also work for ACE. Students should carefully review required course work with ACE options to make the best use of courses to fulfill both degree requirements as well as UNL ACE requirements.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="content-box-m-p">BULLETIN TO USE </p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students (including transfer students) must follow the Undergraduate Bulletin in effect when they <span class="basic-text-bold">enroll</span> in the College of Business Administration.

					<li class="bullet-3">Most students will take course work to fulfill these requirements during the freshman/sophomore year. However, if hours are still needed during the junior/senior year, there may also be options to ‘double count’ course work for NBR 3 (ACE 4) and/or NBR 6 (ACE 9) toward the major (BCA-M) or a minor. This is likely to be of most benefit to ‘transfer-in students’ due to the nature of the program and when ACE requirements are traditionally taken.</li>

				<p class="title-1">Other Requirements</p>
				<p class="title-2">International Business Course Requirement (IBCR)</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">The international business course requirement (IBCR) is to broaden the student’s international perspective. </li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Each student, excluding accounting majors, must include one course which emphasizes an international perspective.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Actuarial Science majors are encouraged to take FINA 450 if they have not met this requirement with completion of NBR 6 – ACE 9 with ECON 321 or MNGT 414.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">The IBCR must be taken for a grade.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="header-paragraph">The course must be chosen from the following approved list of International Business Course Requirement (IBCR) courses. Many of these courses have prerequisites. Some are restricted for education abroad and others may only be offered once a year. Thus, you are advised to plan ahead in scheduling this requirement into your program.</p>
				<p class="title-3">IBCR Courses</p>
				<p class="list">BSAD 491 International Studies in Business and Economics (1-15 hrs)</p>

				<p class="list">MRKT 453 International Marketing <span class="list-ital">(requires 6 hrs of MRKT prerequisites)</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text">If planned carefully, the IBCR course can count in two places. It is not an extra 3 hours of credit, but rather, is 3 hours embedded within other requirements. If selected carefully, it can also count for 3 hours of credit in the major (i.e. MRKT 453 counts for MRKT elective in MRKT major and would count for the IBCR; FINA 450 counts for FINA elective in FINA major and would fulfill the IBCR as well; etc.). On the other hand, if course work for the major is already determined by personal choices, the IBCR can count in electives, and more specifically, for one of the ‘business’ electives needed for most majors.</p>
				<p class="title-2">300/400 Upper-level Requirement</p>
				<p class="basic-text">As part of the degree requirements, all students must complete 12 hours of 300/400 level course work.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">This can be business or non-business course work.</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">Business course work from the Business Core Intermediate (BCI), Business Core Advanced-Major (FIRST Major) or Business Core Advanced-Capstone may NOT be used to fulfill this requirement with exceptions noted below:</li>
					<li class="bullet-2">ABUS majors – 31 hour major – if more than 21 hours of course work for the major is taken at the 300/400-level and of those hours, course work is not being double counted toward the NBR and major, the additional 300/400-level hours can be used to fulfill the 300/400-level requirement. You will need to work with an adviser to be sure this works for you.</li>
					<li class="bullet-2">FINA majors – you will take between 24 and 30 hours for your major; click on the major to determine how many hours will double count for this requirement, depending on which option you select for the major. </li>
					<li class="bullet-2">IBUS majors – may NOT count the 300/400-level course work in language REQUIRED for the major toward this requirement; but any additional 300/400-level language course work that may be taken for a minor WILL count.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Business Core Advanced-Major course work used for a SECOND major (if picked), or course work selected for a minor MAY count.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Non-business course work (NBR) taken at the 300/400 level may be double counted to fulfill this requirement if it is not being used to double count for the 1st major.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">No course may be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis unless it is 398/399 credit. Only 3 hours of 398/399 is allowed for this requirement.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Actuarial science majors and RAIKES students do not need to meet this requirement due to the additional hours at the 300/400 level required for the major/program.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="title-2">Business Course/Business Elective Hours</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Sixty (60) hours of business courses are required for the BSBA degree.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The required hours WILL VARY BY MAJOR, dependent on how requirements have been accepted and/or completed throughout the previous components of the program. While <span class="basic-text-bold">GENERAL MINIMUM</span> guidelines by major are noted below, the Degree Audit will specify <span class="basic-text-ital">minimum business</span> credit hour expectations for each student. You will generally see this addressed under the ELECTIVE section (BUSINESS ELECTIVES) on DARS.</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">ACCT, ECON, BSAD majors – 3 hours</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">MRKT – 6 hours</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">IBUS – 3 hrs plus additional hours if ‘non-business’ course work (maximum 6 hours) is selected for major.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">ACTS – no additional business course work as your major consists of 28 hours of business course work.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">FINA – no additional business course work as your major consists of 24-28 hours of business course work. UNLESS you select AECN 495A under the Banking and Financial Institutions options, and then you will need 3 hours of business electives.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">ABUS and RAIK – no additional business course work required due to intent of major as being ‘business-related’ course work.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Additional hours may be required if there is a variation in hours for NBR, BCF, BCI or BCA, or if there is a violation of the 75% rule, the 15 hour rule, etc.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="header-paragraph">Course work must be taken for a grade except for 398/399 options where grades are generally not permitted</p>
				<p class="title-1">Foreign Languages/Language Requirement</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Other than meeting the minimum requirement for admission to the University, the College does not require any additional work in foreign languages except for the international business major. Students, however, are always encouraged to take language courses.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Minimum Hours Required for Graduation</p>
				<p class="basic-text">A minimum of 120 semester hours of credit is required for graduation; more may be necessary if specific degree requirements have not yet been completed. Most students will graduate with 121 hours as BSAD 150 is not applicable toward degree requirements.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Grade Rules </p>
				<p class="title-2">C- and D Grades </p>
				<p class="basic-text">While students may earn grades of C- or D, there are restrictions and recommendations for such grades and further enrollment options:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">Grade of C or higher in ACCT 201 required to enroll in ACCT 202.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Grade of C or higher in ACCT 202 required to enroll in any 300/400-level ACCT course.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Grade of C or higher required in other departmental higher-level sequencing courses (i.e. MATH 101 to take MATH 104, etc.). See course descriptions to determine enrollment restrictions.</li>

					<li class="bullet-1">Grades of C- or lower can be removed by retaking the course at UNL or within the University system (UNK, UNO).</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Grades of C or better are required to transfer courses from other institutions.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">University of Nebraska System transfers that are not included in the course work identified above require a D- or better grade. Students at system schools need to remember that their grade point transfers with them.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Academic bankruptcy options may be considered for students who have one or two semesters of poor performance.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="title-2">Pass/No Pass Limits</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The Pass/No Pass option is designed for students who want to study areas or topics in which they may have minimum preparation. If used for this purpose, the option can enrich the student’s academic experience without lowering the student’s grade point average. Several restrictions apply when considering the Pass/No Pass option:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">BSAD 101 and BSAD 150 are offered only as Pass/No Pass. Both are required and BSAD 150 does not count toward the 120 hours required for the degree</li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="basic-text-bold">Any</span> student in <span class="basic-text-bold">any</span> College enrolled at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln may <span class="basic-text-bold">NOT</span> take business courses in the College of Business Administration using a the Pass/No Pass option.</li>

					<li class="bullet-1">Students majoring in actuarial science through the College of Business Administration may <span class="basic-text-bold">NOT</span> take any math, actuarial science, or required courses using the Pass/No Pass option. </li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Students may apply no more than 9 hours of elective credit using the Pass/No Pass option (excludes BSAD 101 and 150). </li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Students taking courses to fulfill the requirements of a minor in an area of study outside the College of Business Administration are subject to CBA rules restricting use of the Pass/No Pass option if courses in their minor are used to meet ACE or any college-specific requirements. </li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Students seeking any minor outside the College should verify rules applying to minimum grade expectations and Pass/No Pass options with the adviser for their minor as additional restrictions may apply and they often vary. </li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Students from UNO/UNK/UNMC and from other institutions are subject to the same restrictions listed here of UNL students.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="header-paragraph">Exceptions to the above rules are limited to the following and no other exceptions will be made.</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">An independent study course (398, 399) may be taken in the College of Business Administration using the Pass/No Pass option with the permission of the instructor and the department chair but College of Business Administration students who qualify for this exception may use the independent study course (398, 399) <span class="basic-text-bold">only</span> as elective credit. </li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Advanced Placement grades of P and Credit By Exam grades of P will be accepted to fulfill degree requirements (with the exception of BSAD 150). These hours will not count against the 9-hour-maximum hours permitted. </li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Students who travel abroad and return with “credit” rather than grades from the institution where they studied may use P grades to fulfill degree requirements. These hours will not count against the 9-hour-maximum number of hours permitted.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="title-2">GPA Requirements</p>
				<p class="basic-text">A 2.5 cumulative grade point average is required to apply for graduation, as well as a requirement for enrollment in ACCT 201 and ACCT 202, ECON 215, BLAW 371 and BLAW 372, FINA 361, MNGT 331, MNGT 360, MNGT 475, MNGT/MIST or MRKT 350, and MRKT 341. In some instances, a specific grade is required in certain courses to continue with upper-level course work.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Transfer Credit Rules</p>
				<p class="basic-text">See Maximum/Minimum hour restrictions under Course Exclusions and Restrictions</p>
				<p class="title-1">Course Level Requirements (Hour Requirement 300+)</p>
				<p class="basic-text">In addition to the Business Core Intermediate and Business Core Advanced and Business Course Advanced Capstone requirements, business students must complete an additional 12 hours of 300/400-level course work in their program (not required for ACTS majors and RAIKES students). Students generally fulfill this requirement through their electives, but there may be a few upper-class students who can fulfill the requirement with the ACE course requirements.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Residency</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">At least 30 of the last 36 hours of credit must be registered for and completed in residence at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. </li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Students electing to study abroad in their final semester may apply for an appeal of the residency rule.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="title-1">Extended Education and Independent Study Rules </p>
				<p class="basic-text">There are many opportunities to earn college credit through the UNL Office of On-line and Distance Education. While many of these credits may be applicable toward fulfilling college-specific requirements, there are restrictions for enrollment and completion. Please refer to http://onlineundergraduate.unl.edu/ for additional information. </p>
				<p class="basic-text">Also:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">Prerequisites must still be completed to enroll in these courses</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Courses must be taken for a grade if being used to fulfill specific-degree requirements.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Maximum enrollment options between on-campus and extended education (all options) cannot exceed 19 hours without special permission due to extenuating circumstances.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">No more than 3 hours of “X” (term-based, online courses) can be taken per semester.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Graduating seniors need to pay specific attention to early completion deadlines.</li>
