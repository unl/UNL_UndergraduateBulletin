				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Academic Advising</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Primary academic advising for students in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts is provided by the student’s home department or school. A faculty adviser is assigned by the department or school to help students plan their academic careers and select appropriate courses. Incoming freshmen are counseled during New Student Enrollment by specially trained advisers. Students are responsible for meeting with their academic advisers on a regular basis so that timely and appropriate counsel can be received. Students should contact their department or school office for more information on advising policies and procedures. The Dean’s Office is also available upon referral, but the department or school is the principal source for advising information.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students wishing to include credits transferred from another institution in their program of study must submit a transcript to the UNL Office of Admissions. The Dean’s Office will complete an Evaluation of Transfer Credit form upon receipt of Courses Presented for Transfer from the Office of Admissions. Copies of the Evaluation of Transfer Credit are distributed to the student, the student’s advising file in his or her home department or school, and Registration and Records. </span><span class="basic-text-bold">Students who have previously had transfer credits evaluated in another UNL college must have the credits reevaluated upon entering the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts</span><span class="generated-style">.</span></p>

Students who wish to apply transfer credits toward major requirements or who wish to request any waiver or substitution of requirements must complete a Request for Waiver or Substitution form. The Request for Waiver or Substitution must first be approved by the appropriate Chief Adviser (listed below) and department chair, before being forwarded to the Dean’s Office for final approval. Requests for waiver or substitution involving courses not offered by the student’s home department or school must have the approval (on the Request for Waiver or Substitution form) of the appropriate UNL department.</span></p>

				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Credit by Examination</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Through study or experience that parallels a University of Nebraska–Lincoln course, a regularly enrolled University student may feel prepared to pass an examination on the course content of a specific course for credit in that course. To apply for credit, a student should:</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">1. Consult with the Department Chair.</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">2. Obtain a Credit by Examination Form at the Records Office, 107 Canfield Administration Building, 402-472-3649. Current enrollment in the University must also be verified.</span></p>

See the Dean’s Office, 102 Woods Art Building, for current policy regarding CLEP and AP examinations.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Dual Degrees/Inter College Majors</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Dual Degrees</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students who wish to pursue two degrees at UNL must declare the additional degree on a Dual Matriculation form approved by both colleges involved. Generally, 30 credit hours will be added to the minimum number of credits needed to complete the secondary degree. Students in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts are allowed to declare two degrees within the college, provided that the degrees are different. Two degrees (diplomas) are awarded upon completion.</span></p>

One degree (diploma) will be awarded upon completion.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Honors Program</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts encourages qualified students to participate in the University Honors Program. As far as their plans and programs permit, these students are enrolled in the special sections for superior students. In addition, departments in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts offer special honors sections of regular freshman courses to meet the needs of students with superior preparation in those subjects.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Student Recognition</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Dean’s List</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The College recognizes students for academic achievement during the fall and spring semesters by placement on the College Dean’s List. To qualify for the Dean’s List in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts, students must complete 12 graded hours by the time of the first grade reports and attain a minimum semester grade point average of 3.7. The following do not qualify as part of the 12 credit hours: Pass/No Pass credit, transfer hours, removals of incompletes, and grade changes submitted after the census grade reports. Music education students are not eligible for the Dean’s List during the semester in which they are enrolled in MUED 497 (Student Teaching).</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Degrees with Distinction</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">In recognition of outstanding academic excellence, the College grants the bachelors degree with the designation of With Distinction, With High Distinction, and With Highest Distinction to qualified students. The College Academic Distinction and Awards Committee determines the level of distinction. To be recommended for distinction, candidates must fulfill the specific criteria for Highest Distinction, With High Distinction, or Distinction, as described below, in addition to all of the general criteria and procedures applicable to all distinction classifications.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Highest Distinction.</span><span class="generated-style"> Candidates for the bachelors degree may be awarded Highest Distinction on the basis of the following criteria: outstanding scholastic standing (a cumulative GPA above 3.9 as of the semester preceding graduation) and a thesis project of high quality.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">High Distinction.</span><span class="generated-style"> Candidates for the bachelors degree may be awarded High Distinction by fulfilling one of two sets of criteria: 1) by achieving outstanding scholastic standing (a cumulative GPA above 3.9 as of the semester preceding graduation), or 2) by achieving excellent scholastic standing (a cumulative GPA above 3.8 as of the semester preceding graduation) and a thesis project of high quality.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Distinction.</span><span class="generated-style"> Candidates for the bachelors degree may be awarded Distinction by achieving one of two sets of criteria: 1) by excellent scholastic standing (a cumulative GPA above 3.8 as of the semester preceding graduation), or 2) by achieving high scholastic standing (a cumulative GPA of 3.5 as of the semester preceding graduation) and a thesis project of high quality.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The following criteria apply to all categories: an award of distinction on the basis of GPA alone (for Distinction or High Distinction) should not be considered automatic. In reviewing candidates, a consideration of the GPA is followed by an evaluation of the transcript, which includes: the general quality and breadth of the program, the quality of any transfer credit hours, the number of 300/400-level courses, the number of courses taken Pass/No Pass, and the number of courses retaken to remove D grades. Students must remove any incompletes by the end of the 8th week of classes in the term preceding graduation in order to be considered for recognition. In addition, ordinarily only students who have taken their last 48 hours of graded course work while registered in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts are considered. Consequently, it is possible for a student to have a GPA above the cut-off point and still not receive a recommendation for distinction. Also, graduation with any level of distinction is not automatic with the submission of a thesis project (a requirement for a degree with Highest Distinction, and an option for degrees with High Distinction or with Distinction). It does, however, make a student eligible to be considered for graduation with such honors.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Thesis Project.</span><span class="generated-style"> The thesis project should be substantially more extensive than a term paper. It must be the result of independent, sustained thought, and intellectual curiosity, and it must be completed outside of the structured assignments normally required for a course (excluding 499H courses). A survey of the literature about a particular topic is not sufficient. The project must include a significant written component. All of the following elements are required: 1) an abstract consisting of no more than one page; 2) a clear formulation of the problem, question, or project; 3) a scholarly study which illuminates it, and 4) a substantive conclusion supported by evidence. Students must write in a manner and style that can be understood by a non-specialist in the field. A bibliography and reference to existing literature in the field should be included where appropriate. The phrase “Thesis Project” acknowledges the possibility of having a scholarly honors endeavor which might not conform to the narrow definition of a “thesis”. The following are examples of previous Thesis Projects: 1) the arrangement of a particular symphony and a detailed description of the process of composing arrangements with literary references, 2) the creation of a portfolio of photographic works accompanied by a lengthy historical and literary background, 3) a complete set of costume designs with detailed information about the design, research and garment building process and photographs of the realized costumes. The project must have a significant written component, but it need not be in the format of a formal thesis.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Procedure:</span><span class="generated-style"> Students who elect to work on a thesis project must make arrangements before their senior year by consulting with a faculty member who will supervise the project. The student must register for an independent study course in their major area of study (499H) before proceeding with the preparation of the independent work. The Thesis Project Registration must be completed, with signatures, and filed in the Dean’s Office (102 Woods Art Building) by Tuesday of the second week of classes of the semester of graduation. The Thesis Project supervisor is expected to offer guidance to the student throughout the duration of the project. Two faculty members, the supervisor and the second reader, must complete a Thesis Project Evaluation Form. It is the responsibility of the faculty members to clearly address in their evaluations the extent to which the thesis project meets the three required elements listed above. Thesis projects and faculty evaluations must be submitted to the departmental unit head by the end of the 9th week of the semester of graduation. The unit heads signal departmental approval by forwarding the thesis project and faculty evaluations to the associate dean. Thesis projects not meeting the approval of the department will not be sent forward to the Dean’s Office for further consideration. The College Academic Distinction and Awards Committee conducts the final evaluation of the thesis project. Specific deadlines for each term are indicated on the Registration and Evaluation forms. Materials submitted after the stated deadlines will not be considered by the Academic Distinction and Awards Committee.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">In general, every thesis project is reviewed by the Committee. However, if no member of the Committee feels qualified in the subject area of the thesis project submitted, the Committee solicits the help of another faculty member with an appropriate background. This outside reader then submits to the Committee a formal written evaluation. Even so, members of the Committee must depend heavily on the faculty evaluations.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students in the UNL Honors Program may submit an Honors Thesis, providing all of the above requirements and deadlines are met.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students graduating in August must meet deadlines set for May graduates.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Dean’s Award for Academic Excellence</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">This award is presented annually in the spring to the graduating student from the three graduations (May, August, and December) of the previous calendar year who has achieved the highest level of scholastic performance while in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts. The award is based on the final cumulative grade point average at graduation. In the event of a tie, other factors will be taken into consideration. It is expected that the last 48 hours of the student’s work will have been completed in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">International Study/Study Abroad</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Credit earned during study abroad may be used toward degree requirements if students participate in prior approved programs and register through UNL.

				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Sophomore Standing.</span><span class="generated-style"> For admission to sophomore standing a student must have completed all of the College entrance requirements; earned a minimum of 27 semester hours of credit; and attained a total grade point average of at least 2.0.</span></p>
