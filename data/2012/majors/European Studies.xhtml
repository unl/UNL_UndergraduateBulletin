				<p class="faculty-list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">Coordinator and Chief Adviser: Robert Shirer</span> (modern languages), 1103 Oldfather</p>
				<p class="faculty-list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">Faculty:</span> Amedeo (geography), Balasubramanian (modern languages), Berger (history), Burnett (classics &amp; religious studies), Cahan (history), Carr (modern languages), Dyer (political science), Kleimola (history), A.

				<p class="basic-text">The major and minor programs in European Studies concentrate on European affairs and European culture with a broad historical perspective. The multidisciplinary program draws on the resources of a large number of departments in the College of Arts and Sciences and other colleges at UNL. This course of study is appropriate for students interested in both academic and non-academic careers. The program provides a flexible mechanism which enables students to develop a concentration (chronological, geographical, or disciplinary) in European Studies while simultaneously pursuing a major in one of the traditional academic disciplines, thus preparing for advanced work in such fields as economics, history, modern languages, philosophy, political science, or sociology that would emphasize European issues and problems. For students interested in non-academic careers, the program offers an opportunity to acquire the grounding in European-oriented courses that would be essential for government service, international business and finance, and work with international organizations both public and private with significant European interests.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The program is administered by the coordinator of the European Studies program. Interested students should consult with the chief adviser/coordinator who will assist in outlining a program of studies and offer information about appropriate special topics courses taught at UNL.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Study Abroad.</span> Students completing the major are strongly encouraged to complete at least a semester on a UNL sanctioned Study Abroad program in Europe, to be chosen in consultation with the chief adviser.</p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
				<p class="title-1">Core Requirements</p>
