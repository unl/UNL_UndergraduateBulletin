				<p class="basic-text">The courses and majors in the Department of Classics and Religious Studies have been designed to meet the needs of three categories of students: </p>
				<p class="numbered-list">1 Those who wish to pursue the subjects for general educational purposes; </p>
				<p class="numbered-list">2 Those who plan to major and do graduate work in classics or religious studies;</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">3 Those who want to become high school Latin teachers.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Any student who studies classics and religious studies will acquire the basic elements of a liberal education and a beneficial background for study in professional schools.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Work.</span> The advanced degree of master of arts is offered. For details of this program see the <span class="basic-text-ital">Graduate Studies Bulletin</span>.</p>
				<p class="title-1">The Major in Classics and Religious Studies</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The classics and religious studies major offers a wide range of courses in the civilization, religions and culture of the ancient Mediterranean world, as well as ancient and modern religions broadly conceived. It is an interdisciplinary major with two areas of emphasis, one in Classics and one in Religious Studies. Depending on your chosen emphasis, this major is designed to provide you with an excellent background to pursue graduate work in classical languages and literature, classical archaeology, ancient history, religious studies, literary scholarship, and other humane disciplines. In addition, the broad and humane education offered by the major serves as excellent preparation for careers in law, medicine, journalism, religion, business and education. </p>
				<p class="title-2">The Major in Classical Languages</p>
				<p class="basic-text">This major is intended primarily for those interested in graduate study of the Greco-Roman world. As competency in both Greek and Latin is requisite for graduate study, students must take courses in both languages to complete the major. This major is also appropriate for students who wish to undertake advanced study in related fields such as linguistics, or to teach high school Latin.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Education Abroad.</span> Advanced undergraduates are encouraged to further their education abroad. Students may choose from among several established programs that cover a full academic year, semester, or summer. Most ancient studies programs offer a variety of courses in classics, ancient and modern languages, and history. In addition, students are introduced to the archaeology and art of the culture by frequent trips to sites and museums. These programs include, but are not limited to the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, College Year in Athens, the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome, and The Hebrew University in Jerusalem.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Also, UNL faculty frequently offer archaeological study tours to Greece, Italy, Turkey and Egypt during the summers. The department administers the Clarence A. Forbes Fellowship for education abroad. Further information on education abroad scholarships and programs may be found at http://educationabroad.unl.edu.</p>
