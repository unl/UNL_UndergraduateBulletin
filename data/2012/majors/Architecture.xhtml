				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The primary responsibility of the architectural profession is the design of meaningful environments for human occupation and use. Architects, therefore, must be able to understand the needs and desires of the people who will inhabit and use their creations and then effectively synthesize the complex structural, mechanical and constructional components that go into the design of a building. Clearly, they must possess artistic skill as well as technical knowledge.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The architecture program seeks to increase students’ desire to learn and to develop a capacity for critical thinking and sound judgment while simultaneously developing their innate creative potential. Specifically, the curriculum provides the background and means for the student to:</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">1. Analyze and understand society’s needs and desires,</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">2. Translate these into a physical form,</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">3. Contribute creatively to the building construction industry,</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">4. Search out new problems and contribute to environmental knowledge through research,</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">5. Initiate and review changes in technology and society, and</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">6. Participate in the community that makes decisions affecting the physical environment.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Architecture is a six-year course of study divided into three, two-year segments. Students choosing to study architecture first enter the College as majors in pre-architecture. After completing a two-year curriculum in pre-architecture, students apply for admission into the architecture program’s professional program. The professional program in architecture consists of two components: the two-year </span><span class="basic-text-bold">bachelor of science in design </span><span class="generated-style">(BSD-Architecture) and the subsequent two-year </span><span class="basic-text-bold">master of architecture</span><span class="generated-style"> (MArch).</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students are required to apply for admission into the MArch program after completion of the BSD degree.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">In the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accreditation Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture, recognizes three types of degrees: the bachelor of architecture, the master of architecture and the doctor of architecture. A program may be granted a 6-year, 3-year, or 2-year term of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational standards.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Masters degree programs may consist of an undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree, that, when earned sequentially, constitute an accredited professional education. However, the undergraduate degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="basic-text-bold">The bachelor of science in design is a para-professional degree and a necessary component of the professional program which culminates with the master of architecture degree. The master of architecture degree is the first professional degree. </span><span class="generated-style">The professional master of architecture degree is fully accredited by the National Architectural Accreditation Board (NAAB).</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">In addition to the normal two-year professional program, </span><span class="basic-text-bold">applicants with degrees from other fields may be eligible to enter the three year master of architecture program with deficiencies.</span><span class="generated-style"> These deficiencies are evaluated by the program director on an individual basis after admission resulting from a review of the applicant’s transcripts and other pertinent professionally-related materials by the Student Affairs Committee. Students in this three year program are required to complete 27 to 50 hours of selected undergraduate courses (a minimum of one additional year) prior to pursuing the professional program. Applicants with deficiencies exceeding 50 credit hours are not admitted.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">For those who would like to pursue scholarship in architecture, the architecture program also offers a 36 credit hour, scholarly-nonprofessional </span><span class="basic-text-bold">master of science in architecture degree for students with a bachelors degree in architecture or a related discipline</span><span class="generated-style">. In addition, students can gain the </span><span class="basic-text-bold">doctor of education in administration, curriculum and instruction in architectural education or doctor of philosophy</span><span class="generated-style"> degree in a doctoral area of specialization, entitled Architecture Education, which is jointly sponsored by the College of Architecture and College of Education and Human Sciences. The program is designed for students interested in going beyond the professional degree in architecture to become architectural educators. The major purpose of the program is to provide academic preparation and professional development for those individuals who will serve as: a) faculty members in programs of architecture in public and private post-secondary educational institutions; and as b) administrative leaders of architecture programs in higher education.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">The Master of Architecture Professional Program</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">General</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The professional program in architecture is a six-year course of study that includes a two-year pre-professional segment, a two-year core segment culminating in the award of the bachelor of science in design (BSD) and culminates in the final two-year exploratory segment which results in the receipt of the professional master of architecture degree (MArch).</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Although the bachelor of science in design degree is an integral part of the four-year professional program in architecture, it should be clearly understood that the undergraduate BSD is not a professional degree and is not accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board. Most state registration boards will not acknowledge any degree unless accompanied by an accredited professional degree. </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The accredited, first professional degree awarded by the College of Architecture is the </span><span class="basic-text-bold">master of architecture</span><span class="generated-style"> degree which is awarded at the successful conclusion of the professional program in architecture. This is the only accredited professional architecture program in the state of Nebraska.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Upon successful completion of the two-year pre-architecture program, students who have been admitted to the third year may enroll in the curriculum that leads to the BSD degree and the MArch degree.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The professional program in architecture is structured to develop highly competent professional architects. Each applicant, depending on previous academic training, professional practice, and specific interest, will work with their adviser in establishing a specific program of study suited to his or her abilities and career objectives.</span></p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1"><span class="generated-style">ADMISSION</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Admission to the Architecture Program</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">After completion of the first two years of pre-architecture studies, either within the College of Architecture or at another institution, students may apply for admission to the architecture program.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Pre-architecture students should apply for admission to the professional program in architecture. Successful applicants will have their major changed from pre-architecture to BSD-Architecture option.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Available teaching resources and space capacities limit enrollment to the third year of architectural studies; therefore enrollment limits are established each semester.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Required courses must be completed before advancing to the next year of study.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Minimum Entrance Requirements</span></p>
