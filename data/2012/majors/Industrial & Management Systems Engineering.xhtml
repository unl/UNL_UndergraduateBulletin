				<p class="basic-text">The department offers a curriculum leading to the degree of bachelor of science in industrial engineering, designed to help prepare the student for a wide range of employment positions or further study. Industrial engineering involves the science and practice of designing and managing complex integrated systems. Industrial engineering education provides students with the background to participate in such activities as manufacturing engineering, ergonomics, production planning and control, economic analysis, statistical analysis, quality control, manpower planning, facilities design, packaging, robotics, computer simulation, work place design and analysis, inventory control and optimization. The BS degree in industrial engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Mission and Objectives</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The goal of the IMSE department is to educate students to be effective problem solvers and leaders. We strive to provide students with the education necessary to succeed in their chosen profession and to excel in post-baccalaureate education. The specific (ABET) objectives of the program are to educate students who a short time after their graduation will:</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">1. Meet or exceed the expectations of their employers with respect to problem solving and leadership skills.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">2. Be successful when pursuing post-baccalaureate educational opportunities such as graduate school, professional degrees, and/or professional development. </p>

				<p class="title-1">Laboratories</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Human Factors/Ergonomics Laboratory.</span> Equipment in this facility includes an environmental chamber, oxygen consumption equipment for measuring physical work capacities, force-sensing resistors for grip studies, hand and pinch dynamometers, bicycle ergometer, and electromyography equipment of assessing localized muscle fatigue. Work focuses on assessing risk factors for cumulative trauma disorders in the hand and wrists and on human-computer interaction studies to evaluate user menus and interface design for manufacturing.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Innovative Design and Ergonomic Analysis (IDEA) Laboratory.</span> The IDEA Lab employs user-centered design principles to design products, such as surgical tools or homeland security devices, that are intuitive to learn, easy to use and maintain by involving the end-users in the design process. The IDEA Lab also evaluates these products or those designed by others, such as a reduced size piano keyboard or computer mice, using subjective, usability and objective ergonomic testing, often employing the end-user. To perform the objective ergonomic testing, the IDEA Lab has custom designed equipment to study the movement of multiple joints such as the wrist and hand or the hand and forearm, touch screens to examine aiming capabilities, devices for force or torque measurement, anthropometry electromyography and electrogoniometry and a mock laparoscopic surgical suite.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Nontraditional Manufacturing Research Laboratory.</span> The laboratory is the only facility of its kind in the United States studying advanced manufacturing processes. Advanced manufacturing equipment is needed to machine materials such as ceramics, super alloys, composites and tool steels used by the aerospace, automotive, electronics, and medical components industries. The advanced machining processes studies include electrodischarge machining, electrochemical machining, laser machining, abrasive waterjet machining, abrasive flow machining and ultrasonic machining. Work focuses on improving these advanced processes, developing computer-controlled systems, improving the surface integrity achieved with these processes, designing machine tools and applying the new processes to production of new complex parts while considering economics, safety, and the environment.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">RFID and Supply Chain Logistics Laboratory.</span> The laboratory is equipped with radio frequency identification (RFID) readers, tags, antennas and software. Warehouse management software, conveyor systems, retrieval systems and RFID training simulator are included.</p>
