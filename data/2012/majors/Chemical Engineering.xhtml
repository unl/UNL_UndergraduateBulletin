				<p class="content-box-h-1"><span class="generated-style">DESCRIPTION</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The mission of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln chemical and biomolecular engineering program is to provide qualified students with a foundation in engineering sciences and engineering design methods to prepare them for successful professional careers and to contribute to the needs of society.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">In pursuit of the program’s mission, the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering has established the Educational Objectives given below:</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Educate students in the principles and methods essential to chemical and biomolecular engineering consistent with the curricular requirements of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Broaden perspectives of students regarding social issues and responsibilities, ethics and professionalism.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Graduate BS chemical engineers recognized for excellence and trained to successfully compete for positions in local, state, and national industry, and enter high quality graduate programs throughout the country.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Create and provide access to knowledge that is supportive of the needs of chemical and biomolecular engineering.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Foster an intrinsic curiosity for life-long learning</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Respond to the technical needs for economic development and diversification in the state and region.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering offers a course of study designed for students who plan careers in a wide variety of industries, ranging from the chemical and process industries to biotechnology, electronics, and the environment. Students receive training in the basic subjects of mathematics, English, and physics in common with other students in engineering, but in addition receive extensive training in chemistry. In various courses the emphasis is placed on the fundamental principles of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, mass transfer, separation processes, thermodynamics, kinetics, and process dynamics, as well as process economics and design of chemical processes.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The instructional laboratories provide opportunities for students to operate experimental equipment, to test the theories and correlations developed in the classroom, and to design their own experimental equipment for the solution of special problems.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Graduates are qualified to undertake work in research, design, development, production, maintenance, and technical sales in a wide variety of industries including chemicals, petroleum, petrochemicals, rubber, plastics, agricultural chemicals, food, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, paper, fabrics, aircraft, automotive, electronics, energy conversion, and environmental pollution prevention and control.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering is located in Othmer Hall. A state-of-the-art unit operations laboratory, used to give hands-on chemical process experience, is located there. Laboratory equipment is provided for the study of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, mass transfer, staged operations, process control, thermodynamics, reaction kinetics, and polymerization. The department operates its own microcomputer facility. Additional research equipment is available for independent and graduate study in several areas.</span></p>
