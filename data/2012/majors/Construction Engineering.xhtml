				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Durham School of Architectural Engineering and Construction</span></p>
				<p class="faculty-list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">School Director: Eddy M. Rojas</span></p>

				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">This major integrates engineering, construction, and management courses and is designed for licensed professional engineers to fulfill the construction industry’s need. It resembles the construction management program but provides a greater emphasis on engineering, scientific, and technical courses so that requirements for licensure are met. </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Construction engineers prepare engineering and architectural plans and specifications which they translate into finished projects, such as buildings, bridges, highways, power plants, or other constructed facilities. These projects involve details shared by a team of owners, architects, engineers, general constructors, specialty constructors, manufacturers, material suppliers, equipment distributors, regulatory bodies, labor resources, and numerous others. The constructor assumes responsibility for delivery of the completed project at a specified time and cost and also accepts associated legal, financial, and management obligations.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The construction industry has expanded its technological capabilities in physical and informational systems, and the demand gives graduates numerous opportunities for employment and pursuing an advanced degree.</span></p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1"><span class="generated-style">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students are required to enroll in a predetermined set of courses specifically designed for general construction education. Each student selects, with the approval of his/her adviser, a set of approved electives. Students may take their first four semesters of courses in Lincoln but the last four semesters must be completed at Omaha.</span></p>
