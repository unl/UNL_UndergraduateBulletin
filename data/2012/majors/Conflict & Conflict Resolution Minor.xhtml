				<p class="basic-text">This program is concerned with violent conflict between social groups–the biological, ecological, economic, social, and political basis of such conflict and its relationship to religion, philosophy, and the arts. It examines the history of efforts to resolve or prevent violent conflicts through such means as armaments, negotiations, diplomacy, international law, and nonviolent resistance to violence.</p>
