				<p class="basic-text">The plant biology major is designed to provide a flexible entry for undergraduate students that have an interest in the plant sciences. Once enrolled in the program, students will take a core of classes that will allow them to continue in the plant biology major or would also allow them to easily transfer to other Life Sciences programs. Students will have the opportunity to interact with the faculty of the Center for Plant Science Innovation as well as the above departments and schools for advising and research opportunities.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The goal of the plant biology program is to offer a field of study to students who are interested and talented in the basic sciences and mathematics and who: 1) may never have considered applying this knowledge to plants, 2) have always dreamed of this field of study, and/or 3) have always had an interest in plants but are uncertain that this field of study is right for them.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The purpose of this field of study would be to allow students to explore their knowledge of plants at the following levels: 1) molecular (biotechnology option); 2) cellular and organismal (biological, biochemical/chemical sciences); 3) whole plant/applied physiological (horticulture and agronomy courses); and 4) ecological (ecology and management option). Students may select a bachelor of science track through the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources or a bachelor of science track through the College of Arts and Sciences. Every student must complete a set of core courses that provide breadth in basic sciences. Introduction to Plant Biology should be taken during the first semester in the program. Students also must complete an emphasis to provide depth in one of the following options: Biotechnology or Ecology and Management.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The plant biology program includes a career experience/internship course (BIOS 395; AGRO 295/RNGE 295/SOIL 295; HORT 395; NRES 497) which provides the opportunity to gain work experience in an off-campus setting related to a studentâ€™s academic and career objectives.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">A research project initiated by the beginning of the junior year is required. Presentation of this work will be part of the Exploring Plant Biology course.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students interested in majoring in plant biology through the College of Arts and Sciences are advised to make an initial appointment with the Chief Academic Adviser who will then assign them to a faculty member in Arts and Sciences.</p>
