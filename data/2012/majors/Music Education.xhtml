				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Requirements for Continuing Study Toward a Music Degree</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Music education majors are required to demonstrate adequate skills in applied music, functional keyboard, theory and sight singing before they may continue toward the completion of a degree. The following prerequisites are in place to secure this requirement.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Applied Music–Upper Divisional Qualifying Jury</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Music majors must pass the </span><span class="basic-text-bold">Upper Divisional Qualifying Jury</span><span class="generated-style"> (UDQJ) to be admitted into 300-level applied music. The UDQJ is usually taken in the fourth semester of applied study.</span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">Part I – Basic Skills</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Faculty evaluate the student’s minimal capabilities, including the ability to sight read and perform scales and arpeggios, to determine if the student may continue as a music major.</span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">Part II - Musicianship</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Faculty evaluate the student’s performance to determine if the student may continue as a music major.</span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">Evaluation</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The UDQJ is judged Pass/No Pass, with pass meaning that the student’s basic musical skills and musicianship are judged to be at least minimal for his/her instrument. The jury members in each area will use a general consensus approach in determining Pass/No Pass. A no pass on the UDQJ will indicate an interpretation by the faculty that the student has not completed the requirements for the Upper Divisional Qualifying Jury, resulting in a formal grade of </span><span class="basic-text-bold">incomplete</span><span class="generated-style">. The student then has two additional juries to remove the incomplete. The student may continue to register for applied study at the 200 level for a maximum of two semesters until the incomplete is removed. After one year, the incomplete will expire, causing the grade to revert to a D or F. If the student passes the re-take before the beginning of the 2nd week of classes, he/she will be permitted to register for 300-level applied music courses for that semester.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="basic-text-bold">NOTE:</span><span class="generated-style"> A re-examination will be scheduled only during the first week of classes following a semester in which the UDQJ was failed or during regular scheduled jury times at the end of a semester.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The status of music major is provisional, pending a satisfactory completion of the UDQJ. The result of the UDQJ is validated on the </span><span class="basic-text-bold">UDQJ JURY</span><span class="generated-style"> form with faculty signatures, and filed in the music office.</span></p>

				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The basic program for student teaching in music provides for a full-day experience on a semester basis.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Student Teaching Placement</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Student teachers are placed in many school districts in Lincoln and surrounding areas. Out of state student teaching is also possible. Students should be aware that they may be assigned to a school outside the Lincoln area for student teaching. While student preferences for location will be considered, not all personal preferences can be met.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Criminal History/Background Check</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">All students will be required to have a criminal history/background check completed no earlier than 90 days prior to the first day of their student teaching experience. This will be at the expense of the student. The applications for acceptance into the music teacher education program and into student teaching also require completion of a self-disclosure form.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Removal from Student Teaching </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students participating in practicum or student teaching assignments may be removed from their assigned schools if their conduct suggests a lack of professional commitment and presents a negative influence on the well-being or learning of the students in the schools. If such a problem occurs, the student in question will be removed by the coordinator of Music Field Experiences at the request of the cooperating teacher, building principal, and the university supervisor. In such cases, a written report stating the problem and efforts to correct the situation will be forwarded to the Certification Officer for the College of Education and Human Sciences.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Any student removed from a practicum or student teaching assignment may appeal that decision by submitting a written request to the director of the School of Music within 30 days of the removal. The director will schedule a meeting, request pertinent information from the coordinator of Music Field Experiences, and notify the student several days in advance of the scheduled appeal meeting. Students are advised of their right to seek legal advice and may personally attend the appeals meeting. The decision will be forwarded in writing to the student, to the coordinator of Music Field Experiences, the director of Field Experiences for the College of Education and Human Sciences, and to the dean of the College. </span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Moral Character and Safety Concerns </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Teaching is a profession that requires its potential candidates to be individuals of integrity. Prospective teachers must be able to demonstrate that they are individuals of strong moral character who can make mature decisions for themselves and for their students. Teachers are responsible for the education, safety and well-being for anyone in their charge. Therefore, the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts is interested in training future teachers who show a high degree of moral character and the ability to act responsibly. These individuals must be able to serve as representatives of our College and the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">With this in mind, should the College discover behavior, which in its reasonable judgment, establishes on the part of the candidate a lack of integrity, questionable moral/ethical character, or otherwise indicates a potential of risk to young persons and others in the educational community, the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts reserves the right to deny entry to or dismiss anyone from any program which leads to certification. More specifically, these kinds of behavior shall be adequate foundation to deny any candidate or potential candidate from participation in any practicum, pre-practicum, student teaching, or similar field experience, since the interests and safety of the children and young people present in the classroom, schools, and other venues where these practicum experiences take place are paramount. </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Problematic behaviors, which the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts reasonably determines renders the candidate a risk to the educational community or demonstrates a likelihood of illegal activity, may be established by any credible means, including the facts surrounding a record of arrests and/or convictions. </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Similarly, behaviors which result in a finding by a court or other governmental body that the individual is: </span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">a mentally ill and dangerous person; </span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">mentally incompetent to stand trial; </span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">acquitted of criminal charges because of insanity; </span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">an incapacitated person; </span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">a person in need of a guardian or conservator, or; </span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">a person unable to manage his or her property due to mental illness, mental deficiency, or chronic use of drugs or chronic intoxication are the kind of behaviors which are likely to disqualify a candidate from participation in practicum experiences and other Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts programs. </span></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Nebraska State Department of Education Policy Pertaining to Students with Felony or Misdemeanor Convictions </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The Nebraska Department of Education policy requires that a person with felony convictions or misdemeanor convictions involving abuse, neglect, or sexual misconduct shall not be allowed to participate in pre-student teaching laboratory and classroom experiences or student teach without approval by the Board of Education. To comply with this policy, the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts will require each student to affirm under oath that he or she does not have any convictions in the above named areas prior to each field placement. If a student does have any felony or misdemeanor convictions, he/she is required to meet with Dr. Tom Wandzilak, Certification Officer, Student Services Center, 104 Henzlik Hall, 402-472-8626, as soon as possible. Students with questions pertaining to convictions should contact Dr. Wandzilak.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Application for a Nebraska Teaching Certificate</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">To actively engage in the teaching profession, a candidate must fulfill both the College degree requirements and the professional certification requirements of the State of Nebraska. Undergraduate students apply for the teaching certificate at the same time they apply for the baccalaureate degree in 109 Canfield Administration Building. Post-baccalaureate students completing teacher certification apply to the Chief Adviser for Music Education, Westbrook Music Building. </span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Graduation Without Certification </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">In rare cases, permission may be granted for a student to graduate without a recommendation for certification. This provision is for the student who does not qualify for, or is removed from, student teaching. However, there are times when, because of illness or other extreme situations, a student will decide not to complete all professional requirements. In this situation, the student should contact his or her adviser, then complete a formal request to the coordinator of Music Field Experiences to be allowed to graduate without completing all certification requirements. If permission is granted, the student is expected to complete all professional requirements except student teaching. This includes a passing grade in all methods courses. If a student fails to complete at least one half of the student teaching assignment, the individual will be required to complete a culminating project not to exceed 6 credit hours. </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Any student who graduates without a recommendation for certification will not be recommended for teacher certification in any state. In addition, the student will not be eligible for graduation with honors. If, at some future time, the student wishes to complete certification requirements, he or she must first appeal for readmission to the music teacher education program. At least one semester must pass after graduation before the appeal can be made. If the appeal is granted, the student will be treated as a readmitted student and will complete all requirements in effect at the time of reentry, including passing grades in all methods courses.</span></p>
