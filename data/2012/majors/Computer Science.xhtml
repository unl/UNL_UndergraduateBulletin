				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The UNL Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) offers Nebraska’s only comprehensive program of higher education, research, and service outreach in computer science and computer engineering.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The CSE department offers a challenging baccalaureate degree program in computer science that prepares graduates for professional practice as computer scientists, provides the basis for advanced studies in the field, and establishes a foundation for life-long learning and achievement.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Consistent with these goals, the computer science baccalaureate program develops:</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">The ability to solve a wide range of computing-related problems. Studies include mathematical foundations, computer science theory, programming and software design, system components and design, application of theory, experimentation, design tools and techniques, and documentation and maintenance.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">The ability to work with professionals in fields related to computing and/or having computing applications. Studies include natural sciences and the completion of at least one minor.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Skills to quickly adapt to new work environments, assimilate new information, and solve new problems. Studies include application of theory, experimentation, design tools and techniques, documentation and maintenance, and technical communications.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">The background and perspective necessary to pursue post-graduate education. Studies include computer science theory, application of theory, experimentation, and life-long learning/professional development.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Abilities to work in conformance with societal needs and expectations. Studies include liberal arts and ethical/social issues.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Insight into the world of practicing professionals for collaborations, mutual support, and representing the profession to government and society. Studies include teamwork and life-long learning/professional development, plus students are provided multiple opportunities for involvement in organizations such as ACM and UPE; undergraduate research; and service to the department and community.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The CSE Department also offers a degree of bachelor of science in computer engineering through the College of Engineering. All students majoring in the CSE Department should see their advisers during their first semester to make sure they understand the differences in the requirements of the two programs. Majors must consult with their advisers each semester for registration advising.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="basic-text-bold">Introductory Courses.</span><span class="generated-style"> Entering students may select from several introductory courses, according to their interests and as indicated by the CSE Placement Examination. The </span><span class="basic-text-bold">Computer Science I</span><span class="generated-style"> courses (CSCE 155A, CSCE 155H, CSCE 155E, CSCE 155N, and CSCE 155T) all provide a foundation in designing and programming computing solutions and prepare students for more advanced CSCE courses, including CSCE 156. These courses are designed to meet different interests. CSCE 155A is designed for students majoring in computer science or computer engineering. CSCE 155H is for honors students. CSCE 155E emphasizes computing for systems engineering, such as control systems, mobile computing, and embedded devices. CSCE 155N focuses on numerical and graphical computation in engineering and science, such as applied physics, working with time-sequence data, and matrix applications. CSCE 155T focuses on data and information processing, such as document or database applications, online commerce, or bioinformatics. CSCE 156 is for students with a background in designing and programming computing solutions, such as is provided by Computer Science I. CSCE 101 is for students seeking a broad introduction to computer science with brief instruction in computer programming.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Programs.</span><span class="generated-style"> The CSE department offers several graduate degree programs: master of science in computer science, master of science in computer science with computer engineering specialization, master of science in computer science with bioinformatics specialization, doctor of philosophy in computer science, doctor of philosophy in engineering with computer engineering specialization, doctor of philosophy in computer science with bioinformatics specialization, and joint doctor of philosophy in computer science and mathematics. See the </span><span class="basic-text-ital">Graduate Studies Bulletin</span><span class="generated-style"> for details.</span></p>
