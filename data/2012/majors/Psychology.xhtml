				<p class="basic-text">The undergraduate degree program in psychology is designed to provide students with educational experiences that are conducive to entering diverse careers ranging from academic psychology to such applied fields as counseling, business, and human services. Careful selection of courses from within the required groups and of supplementary courses in psychology and related fields will help students pursue their chosen career. Students who plan to major in psychology should meet with a departmental adviser as early as possible to plan a program of courses consistent with their interests and goals.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Work.</span> Graduate programs leading to the doctor of philosophy degree are offered in the department. A detailed description of these courses appears in the <span class="basic-text-ital">Graduate Studies Bulletin</span>.</p>
