				<p class="basic-text">Economic analysis is useful in many decisions made by individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and governments. In addition to opportunities in teaching, economists are employed in many branches of government and on the staffs of corporations in manufacturing, insurance, banking, brokerage and other financial services. Economists often serve as consultants, either individually or in consulting firms. Today’s economists deal with problems ranging from monetary and fiscal policy, monopoly and competition, environmental improvement, labor relations, regional development, urban reconstruction, economic development and international business and finance. Economics is also a popular major for students planning to enter professional and graduate programs, particularly in law, foreign service, labor relations, or business administration.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The department of economics offers the opportunity for intensive study in twelve specialized economic areas: </p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">General Economics and Theory.</span> Develops fundamental reasoning skills and analytical tools necessary to understand and evaluate economic issues such as specialization, trade, efficiency, costs, markets, prices, resource allocation, money, labor, and government and think critically about economic theory and social provisioning.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph">Comparative International and Regional Development. Examines how human capital, fiscal policy, natural features, and industry clusters influence the comparative advantage, growth, and standard of living in urban and regional economies between and within countries. </p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Econometrics.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Economic Education.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Economic History.</span> Examines the transformation in economic life that accompanied the rise of market capitalism in the United States and focus on the impact of this transformation on the environment, society, and individuals. Courses in this area are integrative in nature and allow students the opportunity to examine the complex nature of economic development throughout American history.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Industrial Organization and Regulation.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Institutional Economics.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">International Trade and Finance.</span> Examines the causes and effects of imports, exports, foreign investment, and migration and their implications for exchange rates, the balance of payments, and economic welfare. </p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Labor Economics.</span> Focuses on how labor markets function and thus, how wages and employment are determined. The decisions of labor market participants are studied, as are employment practices and public policies related to employment issues. </p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Monetary Economics.</span> Studies the role of money and banking system, and of Federal Reserve’s monetary policy in the determination of output, employment, interest rates, prices and business cycles in the domestic and open-economy context. </p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Public Finance.</span> Survey of taxation and public expenditures in theory and practice. Understanding the logic of collective action, the theory of public goods, social welfare, redistribution and intergovernmental fiscal relations.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Quantitative Economics.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text">For some careers, study in related areas is advisable. If you’re interested in:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">Human Resource Management – take additional courses in labor economics and economic history</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Finance – courses in money and banking, intermediate microeconomics, and macroeconomics are helpful</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Marketing – econometrics courses add to your resume</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Accounting – econometrics and public finance courses covering taxes are useful</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="header-paragraph">In planning a program of studies, students should consult a faculty adviser or talk to any member of the economics faculty who would be glad to make suggestions about complementary courses.</p>
