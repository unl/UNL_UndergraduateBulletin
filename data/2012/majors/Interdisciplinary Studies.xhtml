				<p class="basic-text">Intended for students seeking advanced levels of scholarship, this specialized course of study leads to a bachelor of arts degree. It allows a student, with the supervision and approval of an academic adviser, to design an academic program that differs from the established majors offered by the College. The degree program must be based on a clearly defined problem area, a defined body of thought, or a specific educational goal. Courses outside the College may be used, however, all College requirements (including the ACE requirements) must be fulfilled. (See graduation and degree requirements below.)</p>
