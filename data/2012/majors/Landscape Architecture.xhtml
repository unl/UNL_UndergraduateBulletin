				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The primary responsibility of the landscape architecture profession is the design and stewardship of the built and natural environments. Landscape architects, therefore, must be able to understand the process of nature and the impact human settlement has on these ecosystems. This requires professionals to manage storm water, select appropriate plant material, and anticipate human impact all with an eye on a sustainable future.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The landscape architecture program seeks to increase students’ curiosity capacity for critical thinking, collaborative skills, and creative potential in service to the environment and humanity. Specifically, the curriculum provides the background and means for the student to:</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">1. Analyze and understand the relationship between humanity and the natural world it inhabits</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">2. Creatively explore the potential of interventions into the developed and underdeveloped environment</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">3. Search out new problems and contribute to solutions through research and experimentation</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">4. Participate in the community that makes decisions affecting the physical environment</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">General</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The landscape architecture program is a five-year course of study that has been subdivided into a two-year pre-professional, two-year para-professional, and a one-year professional degree unit. Students receive a bachelor of science in design (BSD) at the end of the two two-year segments and a professional bachelor of landscape architecture (BLA) at the end of the fifth year. At the end of the first two year pre-professional segment, students are required to apply for admission into the professional segment of the curriculum. This review involves an evaluation of the students academic record and a portfolio of their work during the preprofessional studies. The landscape architecture program is a candidate program for accreditation. It is anticipated it will be granted for all students as soon as it is allowed under the rules of accreditation defined by the Landscape Architectural Accreditation Board (LAAB).</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students are required to take an array of courses in support of the core studio sequence in addition to the university’s general education courses. These courses include material in horticulture, architecture, planning, and engineering in addition to core landscape architecture classes. This curriculum exposes students to various issues facing the landscape architecture profession including plant material, soils, landscape ecology, construction issues, drainage, site circulation and issues created by urbanism. </span></p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1"><span class="generated-style">ADMISSION</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Admission to the Landscape Architecture Program</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">After completion of the first two years of pre-landscape architecture studies, either within the College of Architecture or at another institution, students may apply for admission to the architecture program.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Pre-landscape architecture majors should apply for admission to the professional program in landscape architecture. Successful applicants will have their major changed from pre-landscape architecture to BSD-Landscape Architecture option.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Available teaching resources and space capacities limit enrollment to the third year of architectural studies; therefore enrollment limits are established each semester.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Minimum Entrance Requirements</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">To be considered for admission to the landscape architecture program, applicants must:</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">1. Be enrolled in the College of Architecture</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">2. Be in good scholastic standing</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">3. Have completed the 1st and 2nd year pre-landscape architecture program of study</span></p>

				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Third-Year Admission Process</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">1. An application for admission may be completed by filling out the online application. The Program receives applications once a year in early February.</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">2. Applicants must submit a portfolio conforming to the defined criteria for the program applied for by the date posted at the completion of the spring semester.</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">3. Any applicant who has previously applied for admission and has not been accepted or who fails to enroll in the professional program in architecture after an acceptance must reapply in the regular manner. Students may apply for admission to the landscape architecture program only three times.</span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">Evaluation</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">A faculty committee of the program will carefully evaluate the applications for admission. The committee considers three elements in their evaluation; cumulative grade point average, a weighted grade point average, and the portfolio of student work. The weighted grade point average gives additional value to the applicant’s achievement in the required LARC prefix course or transfer equivalents in the pre-professional curriculum.</span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">Selection</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Admission to the landscape architecture program will be awarded to applicants who show the greatest professional potential and have demonstrated scholastic achievement. The faculty reserves the right to not fill all available spaces in the professional program in landscape architecture if it determines that the remaining applicants have not performed at an acceptable level.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Admission to the 1-Year Bachelor of Landscape Architecture Program</span></p>
