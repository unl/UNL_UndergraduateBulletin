				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Mechanical engineering is concerned with all forms of energy conversion and transmission; the flow of fluids and heat; the development, design, and operation of machinery and equipment, material structure and properties; and transportation processes. The course of study is designed to give the student fundamental preparation to enter the fields of research, design, operation, production, sales, or management.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The Department of Mechanical Engineering is structured into three major academic areas: thermal-fluid science engineering, systems and design engineering, and materials science engineering. From these three major areas, a student can develop an emphasis area of study by utilizing the various technical elective courses in the major academic areas or an emphasis area could be directed toward studies in aerospace engineering, automotive engineering, robotics, biomedical engineering, computational methods, and others depending upon the technical courses available and the interest of the student.</span></p>
