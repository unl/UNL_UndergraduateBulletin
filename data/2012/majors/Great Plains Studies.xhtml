				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Great Plains Studies is an interdisciplinary/ intercollegiate program of the Center for Great Plains Studies, 1155 Q Street. A major or minor in Great Plains Studies is a useful program for students who plan a career in business, education, planning, policy analysis, agriculture, public relations, marketing, and any profession or career where an in-depth understanding of the Pains region would be advantageous. Courses that comprise the program are based in the following cooperating departments: African American and African Studies; Agricultural Economics; Agronomy; Anthropology and Geography; Architecture; Art and Art History; Biological Sciences; Communication Studies; Community and Regional Planning; Earth and Atmospheric Sciences; English; Ethnic Studies; History; Latino and Latin American Studies; Modern Languages and Literatures; Music; Native American Studies; Natural Resource Sciences; Political Science; Sociology; and Women and Gender Studies. Internships are strongly encouraged and may be used to fulfill major or minor requirements. The Frances W. Kaye Scholarship for $500 is awarded each year to a Great Plains major.</span></p>
