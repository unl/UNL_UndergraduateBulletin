				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">UNL’s agribusiness program is nationally recognized for its innovation and quality. The program is designed to meet the agribusiness industry’s needs for professionals and entrepreneurs who have the educational background to become successful decision-makers in the rapidly changing agribusiness world. Agribusiness students interact with agribusiness professionals through learning and work-related opportunities, both in and out of the classroom. </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Majoring in the agribusiness program prepares students for many agribusiness careers, such as:</span></p>
				<p class="list-indent"><span class="generated-style">Agribusiness Management</span></p>

				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The agribusiness major also prepares students for graduate study in agribusiness, business administration, and agricultural economics.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The agribusiness major is a joint program between the College of Business Administration and the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources. It prepares students for careers in this dynamic and constantly changing field. It is the first program of this kind in the U.S. and is designed to meet the agribusiness industry’s need for employees with training in both business and agriculture.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Agribusiness majors take a blend of courses in business and agriculture that gives the student a balance between the decision-making framework of business and the technical aspects of modern agriculture and food systems. This means emphasis is placed on business and agriculture, making it an attractive degree for agribusiness employers and a very marketable degree for agribusiness students. The program also allows the student to build expertise in their area of interest by taking College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources courses in a specific area.</span></p>

				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Core Requirements</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">As noted in the College Degree Requirements section, all course work for the major must be taken for a grade.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Agribusiness majors may elect to fulfill the Business Core Intermediate (BCI) requirement of MNGT 350/MIST 350 with MRKT 350.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Students interested in agronomy or chemical sales are recommended to take CHEM 109.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Agribusiness majors through the College of Business Administration may </span><span class="basic-text-bold">not</span><span class="generated-style"> count AECN 141 Introduction to the Economics of Agriculture toward the degree unless transferring in from another college.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Double counting options: There are several agriculture courses offered through the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources that may be used to fulfill both requirements for Non-Business Requirements (NBR) for the College as well as for the agribusiness major:</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-2"><span class="generated-style">NBR 3 (ACE 4) – AGRI 115, AGRO 131, ENTO 115, MSYM 109, NRES 108, PLPT 110 may be taken to fulfill the science requirement (NBR 3–ACE 4) as well as a requirement for the major. </span></li>

					<li class="bullet-2"><span class="generated-style">In instances where double counting occurs, course work selected for the first major that is also double counted for NBR may not, in turn, also be used to satisfy the College </span><span class="basic-text-bold">electives</span><span class="generated-style"> of 300/400-level requirement nor may NBR course work double counting for the major be double counted for any minor in which these courses could be used to fulfill minor requirements. In other words, students may choose to have the NBR approved course work double count for the first major </span><span class="basic-text-bold">or</span><span class="generated-style"> minor (not both) and only in the instance of the double count with the minor may the hours also count for the 300/400-level College electives.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">18 hours of the 24 hours required in production, non-production, and elective hours must be taken at the 200 level or above.</span></li>

				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">The program requires and enforces that specific prerequisite requirements be completed by the first class meeting. Concurrent registration in a class that is a prerequisite for another class is NOT allowed. Transfer credit assumes that the prerequisites have been transferred to UNL and appear on the transcript.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">For the International Business Course Requirement (IBCR), most agribusiness majors will take MRKT 453 (providing 6 hours of marketing are done), counting it to fulfill both the IBCR and one of the 300/400-level requirements for the college ELECTIVES requirement. However, for students interested in other areas, the other IBCR courses will work as well.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Students should refer to the Non-Business Requirement (NBR) section for options to complete course work to double count for NBR 3–ACE 4 and/or NBR 6–ACE 9 requirements as well as course work for the major. Please work closely with an adviser.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">12 hours of ELECTIVES for the College (beyond the major) must be done at 300/400-level.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-2"><span class="generated-style">If course work for the agribusiness major (BCA-M) </span><span class="basic-text-bold">exceeds</span><span class="generated-style"> 21 hours at the 300/400-level, a student may appeal (see the agribusiness adviser in CBA 310) to double count the additional hours toward the 300/400-level requirement.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-2"><span class="generated-style">This double counting option will work as long as these hours have not already been double counted as part of the major and NBR requirements.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">60 hours of business course work must be completed for the degree. Given the unique nature of the agribusiness major and program, required course work for the degree, as well as course work for the major, is considered to be ‘business’ related and thus counted toward meeting this college requirement.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">In all instances of ‘double counting,’ the course will count for 3 hours of credit. Students must still meet the minimum 120 hour requirement of course work to graduate.</span></li>
