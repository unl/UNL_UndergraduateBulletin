				<p class="basic-text">The preparation of future Air Force officers is provided through the Air Force ROTC (AFROTC) program. Enrollment is open to any student attending the University on a full-time basis. The curriculum provides the individual with a firm understanding of the concepts of aerospace power and the Air Force mission, organization and operations.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Enrollment in AFROTC is voluntary and accomplished through the fall and spring registration periods. Scholarships are available on a competitive basis. Approximately fifty percent of the students hold scholarships.</p>
				<p class="title-1">General Program</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The Air Force ROTC program consists of the General Military Course (GMC) during the freshman and sophomore years and the Professional Officer Course (POC) for the remaining years. All GMC cadets must complete a four-week field training session during the summer between their sophomore and junior years to enter the POC. Field training is a competitively selected process, and all students wishing to pursue a commission through AFROTC must attend field training.</p>
