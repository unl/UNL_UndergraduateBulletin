				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The courses and majors in the Department of Classics and Religious Studies have been designed to meet the needs of three categories of students: </span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">1. Those who wish to pursue the subjects for general educational purposes; </span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">2. Those who plan to major and do graduate work in classics or religious studies;</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">3. Those who want to become high school Latin teachers.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Any student who studies classics and religious studies will acquire the basic elements of a liberal education and a beneficial background for study in professional schools.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Work.</span><span class="generated-style"> The advanced degree of master of arts is offered. For details of this program see the Graduate Studies Bulletin.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">The Major in Classical Languages</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">This major is intended primarily for those interested in graduate study of the Greco-Roman world. As competency in both Greek and Latin is requisite for graduate study, students are strongly encouraged to take courses in both languages to complete the major. This major is also appropriate for students who wish to undertake advanced study in related fields such as linguistics, or to teach high school Latin.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Study Abroad. </span><span class="generated-style">Advanced undergraduates are encouraged to further their studies abroad. Students may choose from among several established programs that cover a full academic year, semester, or summer. Most ancient studies programs offer a variety of courses in classics, ancient and modern languages, and history. In addition, students are introduced to the archaeology and art of the culture by frequent trips to sites and museums. These programs include, but are not limited to the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, College Year in Athens, the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome, and The Hebrew University in Jerusalem.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Also, UNL faculty frequently offer archaeological study tours to Greece, Italy, Turkey and Egypt during the summers. The department administers the Clarence A. Forbes Fellowship for study abroad.</span></p>
