				<p class="content-box-h-1"><span class="generated-style">DESCRIPTION</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The main function of this department at the undergraduate level is to provide courses that are included in the various curricula in the College of Engineering. These courses fall into the general areas of mechanics of solids, engineering materials, computer-aided analysis in engineering, and experimental stress analysis.</span></p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1"><span class="generated-style">REQUIREMENTS FOR MINOR OFFERED BY DEPARTMENT </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">A minor in engineering mechanics provides a student in another engineering department (civil, industrial, mechanical, etc.) with an opportunity to undertake additional studies in mechanics, beyond the statics/elastic bodies/dynamics sequence. Specifically, the student is required to take twelve (12) credits at the 300/400 level in engineering mechanics. These credits may overlap with the technical electives from the studentâ€™s own department.</span></p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1"><span class="generated-style">OTHER</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The department offers an MS in engineering mechanics; also available is a two-year dual-degree program culminating in an MS in engineering mechanics from UNL and an MS in materials engineering from either the University of Rouen, France or Lulea Technological University, Sweden (requires study abroad); and a PhD (this degree is in engineering, with an engineering mechanics specialization).</span></p>
