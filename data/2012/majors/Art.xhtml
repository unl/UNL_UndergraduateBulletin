				<p class="basic-text">The program in the Department of Art and Art History enables students to attain proficiency in the practice of art and knowledge of the history of art in addition to a general college education. The department is keenly interested in both students who choose art as their profession and who want to devote themselves to a period of intensive education, and those who recognize the cultural advantages or who find in artistic endeavor a high degree of personal enjoyment and satisfaction.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The department offers facilities for instruction and exhibition in a variety of studios, shops, and laboratories. The Sheldon Museum of Art, adjacent to the department, is the setting for traveling exhibitions as well as the display of works of art selected from the Sheldon’s extensive permanent collection. The department also presents exhibitions in its own Eisentrager-Howard Gallery. Both serve as extensions of the studio and classroom learning experience.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Two undergraduate degrees are available to art majors. The student’s career goals will determine the appropriate option. The bachelor of arts degree (BA) is a liberal arts degree with about forty percent of the course work in the Art and Art History Department, providing a wider exposure to various academic disciplines. The bachelor of fine arts degree (BFA) is a professional degree, the usual preparation for professional careers or graduate study in studio art, including about seventy percent of the course work from the Art and Art History Department. </p>
