				<p class="basic-text">The Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences offers a variety of courses leading to the bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degrees in geology and the bachelor of science degree in meteorology-climatology. </p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Work.</span> The Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences offers the master of sciences, and doctor of philosophy degrees. For details see the Graduate Studies Bulletin.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Major in Meteorology-Climatology</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences offers a program leading to the bachelor of science degree in meteorology-climatology. This program combines basic atmospheric science and climatology courses with a rigorous training in mathematics, computer science, and physics. This comprehensive degree program will prepare students for possible employment in state, federal, and private agencies which are involved in the many applied fields of meteorology-climatology. This series of courses will also assist the student in preparation for graduate-level studies in meteorology-climatology. The meteorology-climatology degree program fulfills the recommended curriculum of the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). The degree program also meets or exceeds the minimum hiring requirements of the National Weather Service. The University of Nebraska–Lincoln is a member of UCAR.</p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
				<p class="title-1">Specific Major Requirements</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The following curriculum represents the minimum requirements for a major in meteorology-climatology. </p>
				<p class="title-3">GROUP A: Core Courses</p>
				<p class="requirement-sec-2">METR 200, METR 205, METR 223, METR 311, METR 312, METR 323, METR 341, either METR 442 or METR 470, and one of the following: METR 463, METR 464, or METR 465</p>
				<p class="title-3">GROUP B: Electives</p>
				<p class="requirement-sec-2">At least 12 hours of 400-level METR courses not used to fulfill Group A </p>
				<p class="title-3">GROUP C: Required Related Courses</p>
				<p class="requirement-sec-2">MATH 106, MATH 107, MATH 208, MATH 221; STAT 380; PHYS 211 &amp; PHYS 221, PHYS 212; CHEM 109; CSCE 155N</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">NOTE:</span> A minor in math can be obtained with the completion of the required mathematics and statistics courses. A minor in broadcasting is also available with additional course work from the College of Journalism and Mass Communications.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Program Assessment.</span> In order to assist the department in evaluating the effectiveness of its program in meteorology/climatology, each major during their last semester prior to graduation, will participate in an exit survey to gather information about the program from the student’s perspective. The undergraduate adviser will inform students of the scheduling and format of the assessment activities. </p>
				<p class="basic-text">Results of participation in this assessment activity will in no way affect a student’s GPA or graduation.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Tracks/Options/Concentrations/Emphases Requirements</p>
				<p class="basic-text">For an emphasis in meteorology students should take METR 442 as their capstone course (ACE 10) from Group A and choose appropriate meteorology courses from Group B. For an emphasis in climatology students should take METR 470 as their capstone course (ACE 10) and choose appropriate climate courses from Group B. It should be noted that these are suggestions only and that students should meet with the Undergraduate Adviser to develop a personalized plan that will fulfill Group B requirements and match their career goals.</p>
