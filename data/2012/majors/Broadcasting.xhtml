				<p class="basic-text">The broadcasting major offers courses leading to a wide variety of careers in the telecommunications industry. Building on a solid base of instruction in radio, television, and online journalism, the major has broadened its curriculum in response to advancing technology and new electronic media. Broadcasting offers courses in news gathering and dissemination, sports reporting, videography, sales, management, programming and other specializations including the use of audio and video on the Internet and the World Wide Web. Courses are designed to develop both a comprehensive understanding of theoretical principles and professional skills. Most courses involve extensive practical laboratory work in addition to classroom lectures and discussions.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">KRNU, a professionally managed FM radio station, is an integral part of the instructional program. With studios in Andersen Hall, KRNU operates year-round and serves an audience of potentially 250,000 persons in the Lincoln area, plus a global audience via the Internet. Student-produced programs aired on KRNU have won many awards in competition with other student groups as well as with commercial stations. Broadcasting students received a Bronze Oscar in the student documentary category for their 2003 production of “Cuba: An Illogical Temple.”</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students have also had success in the national Hearst competition, including the broadcast news national winner in 2006 and several students placing in the top five.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">In addition, students may work and take classes in the studios of the Nebraska Educational Television Network, one of the premier ETV facilities in the nation.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students also produce television newscasts and entertainment programs, which are distributed throughout Lincoln via cable television. The broadcasting program operates two television studios in Andersen Hall.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The broadcasting faculty enjoys an excellent rapport with the industry, and its members are actively involved in professional media organizations, frequently serving in leadership positions. Students are encouraged to further their professional goals through participation in student organizations such as the National Broadcasting Society, Alpha Epsilon Rho, the Society of Professional Journalists, the Radio-Television News Directors Association and other broadcasting entities.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Broadcasting faculty assist students in acquiring internships and professional work experience prior to graduation. Last year more than 100 media-related internships and professional part-time jobs were held by broadcasting majors. Graduates are working for media organizations throughout the nation, often in positions of middle and upper management.</p>
