				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">A degree in agricultural education is designed to prepare students with the necessary communication and interpersonal skills, leadership training, and knowledge of technical agriculture to be a teacher of agricultural education at the secondary or postsecondary level, or accept employment in agribusiness leading to positions in training and/or development. The degree provides good preparation for work in agricultural extension, positions in foreign service, and agricultural educators in business and industry. Many students graduate with a dual degree in agricultural education and another degree in the College. Agricultural education students may elect to follow the teaching options or the leadership option.</span></p>

				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Major/Department Admission</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students desiring to be admitted to the Teacher Education program in the Department of Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication should apply as early as possible after the completion of at least 42 credit hours (at least one year before they plan to student teach). Student teaching is conducted off campus through university-approved agreements with cooperating secondary schools. Plans for student teaching must be made early.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">To be admitted in full standing for student teaching, the student must have passed the Pre-Professional Skills Test, and have a minimum scholastic grade point average of 2.50. Students with less than a 2.50 GPA may be given provisional admission. Student Teaching (ALEC 431) is available as Pass/No Pass only. Meet with your adviser to plan student teaching.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Other Admission Requirements </span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Teaching Certificate</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Successful completion of the teaching endorsement requirements, along with a recommendation by the Department of Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication, warrants recommendation for a Nebraska Secondary Teaching Certificate by the Nebraska Department of Education, with an endorsement to teach secondary agricultural education (7-12). The choice is available to students to complete course work qualifying for subject endorsement in biology.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students in other agricultural degree programs may qualify based upon meeting the teaching certificate requirements.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Criminal History/Background Check</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">All students completing student teaching in Agricultural Education during the fall, 2007 semester or after will be required to have a criminal history/background check completed prior to their student teaching experience. The background check must be completed as a part of the application for admission to student teaching.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Nebraska State Department of Education Policy Pertaining to Students with Felony or Misdemeanor Convictions</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The Nebraska Department of Education policy requires that a person with felony convictions or misdemeanor convictions involving abuse, neglect, or sexual misconduct shall not be allowed to participate in pre-student teaching laboratory and classroom experiences or student teach without approval by the Board of Education. To comply with this policy, the Department of Agricultural Education will require each student to affirm under oath that he/she does not have any convictions in the above-named areas prior to each field placement. If a student does have any felony or misdemeanor convictions, he/she is required to meet with Dr. Tom Wandzilak, Certification Officer, Student Services Center, 104 Henzlik Hall, 402-472-8626, as soon as possible. Students with questions pertaining to convictions should contact Dr. Wandzilak.</span></p>

				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Environmental Communications Minor</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">A minor program in environmental communications is available through the Department of Agricultural Leadership, Education and Communication in cooperation with the School of Natural Resources. The minor is designed to provide students with interests in environmental studies and natural resources, additional expertise that can be used in a variety of career paths and settings. It is also designed to provide the student with a general understanding and working knowledge of the interactions that do–and can–exist between the agricultural sciences, natural resources, and the environment. The ability to communicate effectively with the public about these relevant issues, in articulate, analytical and substantive ways, is becoming an increasingly valued and necessary skill, self-evident to many groups including policy makers, legislators, regulators, advocates, business, and the general public. The 12-hour minor is comprised of the following courses:</span></p>
