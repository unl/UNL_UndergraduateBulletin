				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The College of Journalism and Mass Communications has traditionally offered majors in both broadcasting and news-editorial journalism. Because of the changes in the journalism industries served by our students and graduates, however, we are in the process of combining those majors into one journalism major. This major will offer courses leading to a wide variety of careers in print, broadcasting and online journalism. </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The journalism curriculum, combined from the previous broadcasting and news-editorial programs, is built on intensive reporting and writing, and all students begin with the same foundation. All students are required to take courses in reporting and writing, copy editing, visual literacy, mass media law, contemporary issues in mass media and multimedia journalism. Elective choices include courses in magazine writing, depth reporting, feature writing, sports writing, business writing, science writing, photography, design, broadcast news writing, videography and advanced editing. Students may also choose an emphasis in broadcast production, in which they will enroll in courses in audio and video production.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Many of the journalism faculty members have extensive industry experience at such media organizations as The Wall Street Journal, The Miami Herald, The Detroit News, ABC News and The New York Times. The faculty continues to be connected to the industry, and its members are actively involved in professional media organizations. Students, likewise, are encouraged to further their professional goals through participation in student organizations such as the National Broadcasting Society, Alpha Epsilon Rho, the Society of Professional Journalists, the Radio-Television News Directors Association and the American Copy Editors Association.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Faculty members prepare students for the job market by combining class work with actual experience. The primary outlet for student journalism is NewsNetNebraska, the college’s student-produced website. In addition, students have the opportunity to work on a weekly television news broadcast, Star City News; KRNU, a professionally managed FM radio station; and regularly scheduled magazines, which publish the work of depth reporting and photography students.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The journalism program places a great deal of importance on professional internships, and students in recent years have worked at such media organizations as ABC News, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Dallas Morning News, Fox News, The Omaha World-Herald, The Des Moines Register, The Norfolk Daily News and The Atlanta Constitution, as well as numerous other newspapers and local television stations. The college also has partnerships with two media organizations that offer paid internships during the school year in Lincoln:</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="generated-style">A</span><span class="header-paragraph-title">BC News on Campus. </span><span class="generated-style">The college has a bureau, staffed year-round with four or five students at a time, which provides articles, photographs and video packages to ABC News in New York. Student work has appeared on Good Morning America and World News Tonight, as well as several of ABC’s Web sites.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">World-Herald Fellows. </span><span class="generated-style">The Omaha World-Herald, Nebraska’s largest newspaper, works with the college to teach a course called “The Real World” in which World-Herald staff members offer students insight into working for a newspaper. Each semester the World-Herald chooses four students to be “fellows,” and they work in the newspaper’s Lincoln bureau.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Additionally, journalism students achieve national recognition by successfully competing in such programs as the Hearst Journalism Awards, Sigma Delta Chi Awards, the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Awards and the Society of Professional Journalists’ Mark of Excellence Awards. </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">For the 2011-2012 academic year, the term “journalism” replaces the term “news-editorial,” and “broadcasting” continues to refer to both the news and production tracks in broadcasting.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">All courses previously shown as NEWS are now shown as JOUR; therefore, the former news-editorial major is identified as the journalism major.</span></p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1"><span class="generated-style">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Specific Major Requirements</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The courses required for a 40-hour major in journalism are as follows:</span></p>
				<p class="list"><span class="generated-style">JOUR 101, JOUR 162, JOUR 163, JOUR 164, JOUR 165, JOUR 201, JOUR 202, JOUR 302, JOUR 350, JOUR 486, JOUR 487; and 3 hours from BRDC 369, BRDC 370, BRDC 372, JOUR 303, JOUR 305; or a 400-level reporting course; and 6 elective hours from the college.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="generated-style">Students may complete two majors in the College of Journalism and Mass Communications by completing all requirements for each major; however, the second major in the college will not take the place of a concentration</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Tracks/Options/Concentrations/Emphases Requirements </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Three 12-hour concentrations or one 24-hour concentration and one 12-hour concentration. A specified minor may take the place of one 12-hour concentration. A major of 24 or more hours may take the place of a 24-hour concentration. </span><span class="basic-text-bold">Any of these options must be from outside the College of Journalism and Mass Communications.</span><span class="generated-style"> The concentration requirement must be fulfilled with at least 36 hours from outside the College of Journalism and Mass Communications. A 24-hour concentration could be satisfied by a major from another college. One of the three concentrations must be from a liberal arts department. See the degree audit for a list of the traditional liberal arts departments. Normally, concentrations are defined as a minimum of 12 hours taken from one department or a specified interdisciplinary program that does not have a designated minor. In each concentration, at least 6 hours must include courses numbered 200 or higher. The college additionally recognizes a 24-hour fine and performing arts concentration and a 12-hour business concentration. </span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Fine and Performing Arts Concentration</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students in the College of Journalism and Mass Communications may complete a 24-hour interdisciplinary concentration in courses from the College of Fine and Performing Arts. This concentration would include classes in: 1) art and art history; 2) music; 3) theater and film; and 4) dance.</span></p>
