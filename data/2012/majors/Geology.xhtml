				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The Department of Geosciences offers a variety of courses leading to the bachelor of arts and bachelor of science degrees in geology and the bachelor of science degree in meteorology-climatology. </span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Work. </span><span class="generated-style">The Department of Geosciences offers the master of sciences, and doctor of philosophy degrees. For details see the Graduate Studies Bulletin.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Major in Geology</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The Department of Geosciences offers both the bachelor of science and the bachelor of arts degrees in geology. The bachelor of science program is designed for those who expect to continue in graduate work and become professional geoscientists. Undergraduate training in geology is beneficial in many other fields such as teaching at the precollege level, urban planning, law, civil engineering, environmental studies, and museum work. Students preparing for these or similar areas are advised to take the bachelor of arts program, which is strong in fundamental geology but does not provide the ancillary requirements for admission for most graduate study in geology. </span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Field Trips.</span><span class="generated-style"> Many of the geology courses require field trips that often include camping and primitive conditions. The number of trips and their duration are a function of the requirements of the particular course.</span></p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1"><span class="generated-style">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Specific Major Requirements</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Bachelor of Science</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The following curriculum, leading to the bachelor of science degree, is recommended as a minimum program for the pre-professional geologist. All candidates for this degree are required to attend a field camp.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The major must include 30 hours in eight courses (GEOL 101, GEOL 103, GEOL 210, GEOL 211, GEOL 310, GEOL 340, GEOL 410, and GEOL 460). An additional 12 credit hours must be acceptable electives above the 100 level, with at least one course at the 400 level. Acceptable electives include any GEOL courses at the 200, 300 or 400 level as well as METR 200 or METR 370.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">No minor is required, however the student must complete a set of ancillary science and math requirements totaling 30 credit hours. These must include MATH 106 and MATH 107, CHEM 109 or CHEM 113, and PHYS 141 and PHYS 142 or equivalents. The additional 6 required credit hours in science and math must consist of courses from the following list:</span></p>
				<p class="list-indent"><span class="generated-style">ASTR 204</span></p>
				<p class="list-indent"><span class="generated-style">BIOS 101/BIOS 101L, BIOS 102, BIOS 103, BIOS 104H, BIOS 109, BIOS 112/BIOS 112L, BIOS 206</span></p>
				<p class="list-indent"><span class="generated-style">CHEM 110 or CHEM 114, CHEM 116 or CHEM 221, (CHEM 251 and CHEM 253) or (CHEM 261 and CHEM 263), CHEM 471</span></p>
				<p class="list-indent"><span class="generated-style">MATH 208, MATH 221, MATH 380</span></p>
				<p class="list-indent"><span class="generated-style">STAT 218</span></p>
				<p class="list-indent"><span class="generated-style">PHYS 311, PHYS 343</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">A candidate for the bachelor of science in geology should complete, by the end of the sophomore year, MATH 107; CHEM 113 (or equivalent) and GEOL 210, GEOL 211. By the end of the junior year the student should also have completed GEOL 310 and the physics requirement. GEOL 460 is to be taken between the junior and senior years.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Bachelor of Arts</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The bachelor of arts program consists of the college comprehensive education requirements with at least one semester of chemistry and MATH 102 or MATH 103, plus a minimum of 30 hours in geology including GEOL 101, GEOL 103, GEOL 210, GEOL 211, GEOL 310, and GEOL 340. Remaining credits in geology may include only 4 hours at the 100 level.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Program Assessment.</span><span class="generated-style"> In order to assist the department in evaluating the effectiveness of its programs, majors will be required:</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">1. To maintain and submit a portfolio of material produced for the required Summer Field Course, GEOL 460 (for BS students), or for the required Depositional Environments course, GEOL 310 (for BA students). Course instructors will inform students of the required contents, deadlines and procedures.</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">2. In their final semester, to participate in an exit interview/survey. The undergraduate adviser will inform students of the scheduling and format of their assessment activity.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Results of participation in this assessment activity will in no way affect a studentâ€™s GPA or graduation.</span></p>
