				<p class="basic-text">A strong mathematics background is essential to an increasing variety of careers. The Department of Mathematics encourages students to select a coherent body of courses in mathematics and in other disciplines that are consistent with their academic and career goals.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The Department of Mathematics offers four options for the major in mathematics. Each student majoring in mathematics should select an option that meets their academic and career needs by completing a Program Declaration form in consultation with the Department’s Chief Undergraduate Adviser. Ideally, this should be done prior to completing two mathematics courses beyond the calculus sequence. As appropriate, students can change their Program Declaration to select a different option or modify the program of study subject to the approval of the Chief Undergraduate Adviser.</p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="basic-text-bold">NOTE:</span> Students with previous credit in any calculus course may not register for or earn credit in MATH 100A, MATH 101, MATH 102, MATH 103, or MATH 104, without first receiving special written permission from the Chief Undergraduate Adviser.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Work. </span>The advanced degrees of master of arts, master of science, master of arts (or science) for teachers, and doctor of philosophy are offered by the Department of Mathematics. For details of these programs, see the Graduate Studies Bulletin.</p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS </p>
