				<p class="basic-text">The African Studies minor affords students the opportunity of widening their academic horizons to include a part of the world that, because of its past and continuing relevance to the American continents, deserves study. The minor will contribute to the students’ understanding of the diverse peoples and cultures of Africa, their awareness of the relativity of cultures, and, ultimately, to a better understanding of their own society. The minor, which is interdisciplinary, will appeal not only to students in the humanities, social sciences, and education, but also to students who plan to do international work.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The minor in African-American Studies is designed to expose students to a program of study concerning African-American culture, life, and history in the United States as well as the African experience on the continent and/or in the Diaspora.</p>
