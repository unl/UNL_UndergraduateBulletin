				<p class="basic-text">Chemistry deals with the analysis, structure, properties, and synthesis of matter ranging in size from single atoms to biologically-active small molecules to DNA and proteins. A degree in chemistry prepares students for many career options: industry (research, analysis, production), teaching, graduate studies, or professional schools. The bachelor of science (BS) is recommended for students planning graduate studies or professional careers in chemistry and is also an excellent choice for pre-medicine. The bachelor of arts (BA) program is designed for students needing undergraduate training in chemistry as preparation for professional careers outside of chemistry and fits easily into pre-medical, pre-pharmacy, pre-health, and pre-law degree programs. A degree with a chemistry emphasis is available to students enrolled in the Environmental Studies program (consult that entry for details). The chemistry department hosts a Web page with other information (scholarships, etc.) relating to the undergraduate programs at http://chem.unl.edu/undergrad/.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Laboratory Fee and Deposit.</span> Students who enroll in chemistry laboratory courses pay a special fee to defray the cost of materials and equipment. The special fee is applied to tuition in the amounts given in the <span class="basic-text-ital">Schedule of Classes</span>.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Breakage Costs.</span> Glassware and equipment that are lost or damaged by the student are charged to the student’s N-card.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Work.</span> The advanced degrees of master of science and doctor of philosophy are offered. For details, consult the <span class="basic-text-ital">Graduate Studies Bulletin</span>.</p>

				<p class="numbered-list">1. To take a standardized chemistry exam during their final year in the program. It will be administered during the middle of the spring semester at a time that is mutually agreeable to all graduating seniors.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">2. To participate in an exit interview with a designated faculty member.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">3. To submit a copy of the report written for CHEM 399 to the departmental office for evaluation.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The Vice-Chair will inform students of the scheduling and format of assessment activities. </p>
				<p class="basic-text">Results of participation in these assessment activities will in no way affect a student’s GPA or graduation.</p>
