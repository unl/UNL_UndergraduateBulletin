				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Admission Categories</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Assured Admission. </span><span class="generated-style">First-time students who graduate from an accredited high school, have successfully demonstrated competency in the required five subject areas, and meet minimum performance requirements are assured admission to the University. These five subject areas are English, mathematics, natural sciences, social studies, and foreign language. Successful completion of a minimum of 16 core course requirements, either at the secondary school level or at the college level, is typically used to demonstrate competency. Performance requirements for freshmen include an ACT composite score of 20 or higher, or an SAT combined score of 950 or higher, or a high school class rank in the upper one-half of the graduating class. </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Prospective transfer students are also expected to demonstrate competency in the core course requirements, as well as have a cumulative grade point average of at least a C average (2.0 on a 4.0 scale) and at least a C average in the last semester of college enrollment. Several UNL undergraduate colleges require higher grade point averages for transferring into specific academic programs. See the college sections in this bulletin for more specific information about transfer requirements.</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Removal of Deficiencies.</span><span class="generated-style"> Because admission requirements establish the level of knowledge and skills which are needed for a student to succeed at UNL, students who are admitted with core course deficiencies are expected to quickly remove them. Although students are encouraged to remove all admission deficiencies prior to enrolling at UNL by taking course work in high school, by correspondence, or in a community college, students who choose to remove their admission deficiencies at UNL will be required to enroll immediately in the specified courses needed to remove their deficiencies and to remain enrolled in such courses each term until their deficiencies are fully removed.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students must remove admission deficiencies within the following time periods:</span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">4th year math admission deficiency–no later than either 1) the semester in which the student has attempted his or her first 30 credit hours at UNL, or 2) if longer, one calendar year from the time the student first enrolled at UNL.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">any foreign language admission deficiency–no later than either 1) the semester in which the student has attempted his or her first 60 credit hours at any campus in the university system, or 2) if longer, two calendar years from the time the student first enrolls at any campus in the university system.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">all other admission deficiencies–no later than either 1) the semester in which the student has attempted his or her first 30 credit hours at any campus in the university system or 2) if longer, one calendar year from the time the student first enrolled at any campus in the university system.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">These time periods represent the maximum period for removing admission deficiencies. Shorter periods may apply in individual situations depending upon a variety of factors considered in the admission review process (e.g., the expected graduation date, the program in which the student wishes to enroll, the sequence of courses required to remove the admission deficiency).</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students who fail to successfully compensate for their admission deficiencies within the established time will not be allowed to continue their enrollment at UNL until they have removed all their deficiencies.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">College-level course work taken to remove high school core course requirements will not count toward graduation requirements in most of the undergraduate colleges at UNL. It will be used as elective credit only in some of the undergraduate colleges. The College of Business Administration and the College of Architecture will not count these courses towards meeting graduation requirements, not even as elective credit. The College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources and the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts will consider courses taken to remove deficiencies to satisfy graduation requirements. The College of Education and Human Sciences course work taken to remove high school deficiencies policy is available in the College Academic Advising Center, 105 Henzlik. Additional information about University policies governing the removal of admissions deficiencies is available from the student’s academic adviser.</span></p>
				<p class="title-1"><span class="generated-style">Undergraduate Transfer Credit Policy</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">This statement outlines important information for students who present undergraduate credit for transfer to a degree program at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Transfer credit is any post-secondary credit earned at an institution outside the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, including other institutions in the University of Nebraska System (NCTA, UNK, UNO, and UNMC). </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The college within the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in which a student enrolls (the degree college) has ultimate responsibility for determining how all credit, including transfer credit, will apply to a specific degree program. Evaluation of transfer credit is based on a review of the comparability of the nature, content and level of the learning experience and its appropriateness to the student’s degree program. The acceptance and use of transfer credit are subject to limitations in accordance with the educational policies of The University of Nebraska–Lincoln. </span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Transfer Credit Practices</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The University of Nebraska–Lincoln endorses the Joint Statement on Transfer and Award of Academic Credit approved by the American Council on Education (ACE), the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO), and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). The current issue of Transfer Credit Practices of Designated Educational Institutions, published by AACRAO is an example of a reference used in determining transfer credit.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Applicants must request an official transcript sent to the Office of Admissions from each college attended. Failure to provide transcripts from all colleges or universities attended may result in denial of the application or dismissal from the university. Grades from institutions outside the Universities in the NU System will be used for evaluation and admission, but will not become part of the University cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA). Each degree college determines its policy for acceptance and application of grades below C to degree requirements.</span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">A. Credit presented for transfer from within the University of Nebraska System </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Credit earned at any institution within the University of Nebraska System will be accepted by UNL. Applicability to degree requirements is determined by the student’s degree college. Direct course equivalencies with UNK, UNO and </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">UNMC, established by faculty, are maintained by the NU System and are available on-line at http://coursefinder.nebraska.edu. Applicability of courses without direct equivalencies will be at the discretion of the degree college. </span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">B. Inter-institutional Agreements</span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Associate to Baccalaureate Agreements.</span><span class="generated-style"> Agreements have been established for specific programs at selected community colleges. </span></p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Transfer courses equivalencies.</span><span class="generated-style"> Direct equivalencies have been established by UNL faculty for courses from a number of institutions including Nebraska Community Colleges and Nebraska College of Technical Agriculture. Applicability of courses without direct equivalencies will be at the discretion of the degree college. Transfer Course Equivalency tables are available on-line at http://admissions.unl.edu/tequiv/index.php. While every effort is made to ensure accuracy, this information is subject to change.</span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">C. Credit presented for transfer which requires additional review by the degree college.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The following types of transfer credit require additional review by the student’s degree college within UNL to determine applicability to the student’s program of study. </span></p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Credit in courses presented for transfer which do not have a direct equivalent as established by UNL faculty. </span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Credit in courses determined by University of Nebraska–Lincoln to be of a developmental, vocational, or technical nature.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Credit in courses or programs in which the institution granting the credit is not directly involved. </span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Credit presented for transfer from institutions not accredited by one of the regional accrediting commissions. (www.chea.org)</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">In determining the acceptability of transfer credit from colleges which are not regionally accredited, acceptance practices indicated in the current issue of Transfer Credit Practices of Designated Educational Institutions, an AACRAO publication, will be used as a guide. For institutions not listed in the publication, guidance is requested from the designated reporting institution of the appropriate state.</span></li>
					<li class="bullet-1"><span class="generated-style">Credit presented for transfer from institutions outside the United States. Transfer credit from foreign educational institutions may be granted after a determination of the type of institution involved, its recognition by the educational authorities of the foreign country, and an evaluation of the content, level, and comparability of the study to courses and programs at University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Credit may be granted in specific courses or assigned to general areas of study. Questions about foreign credentials and educational systems should be directed to the Office of Admissions.</span></li>

				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">Applicability of transfer credit to degree requirements</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The student’s degree college within the University of Nebraska–Lincoln has ultimate responsibility for determining how all credit, including transfer credit, will apply to a specific degree program.</span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">Transfer credit from two-year institutions</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">No more than 66 semester or 98 quarter credits earned at two-year colleges can be applied to an undergraduate degree from University of Nebraska–Lincoln.</span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">Lower division credit</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Lower division courses transferred to UNL will generally be used to meet lower division requirements. In the event that a lower division transfer course is used as a substitution for an upper division requirement at the university a student may be required to complete additional upper division hours for graduation.</span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">Residency requirement</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The University’s colleges may require that specific courses or a certain number of credit hours be completed on the UNL campus to satisfy the residency requirement.</span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">Dual Credit earned while a student is enrolled in high school</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">When a student earns both high school and college credit for a course, the student must present a transcript from the original postsecondary institution offering credit for the course. Such courses will be evaluated as transfer credit. </span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">Other credit earned while in high school</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Many students enroll in one or more college courses while enrolled in high school. An official transcript of all courses attempted must be presented upon application unless the credit was earned at UNL. Credit from institutions outside the University of Nebraska–Lincoln will be evaluated as transfer credit </span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">Credit earned in the United States Armed Forces</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students with military service will be awarded 1 credit of military science for every three months of active duty up to a total of four credits. Credit for technical or specialized schools will be accepted to the extent that the material is applicable toward degree requirements at UNL.</span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">Credit by Examination (CBE)</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Programs accepted at University of Nebraska–Lincoln include the Advanced Placement (AP) Program, the International Baccalaureate (IB) Examinations, the College Level Examination Program (CLEP), and departmental examinations. For information on specific exams and required scores accepted for credit at UNL see: http://admissions.unl.edu/advanced/#. Credit by Exam (AP, IB, or CLEP credit) may not be transferred directly to University of Nebraska–Lincoln from another institution. However, the scores from these examinations may be sent to University of Nebraska–Lincoln from the testing agency, and credit will be awarded based on UNL’s AP, IB, and CLEP policies.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students who anticipate applying to professional programs should inquire about the acceptability of Credit by Exam before registering for exams. </span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">Credit by Departmental Examination </span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Credit by departmental examination allows regularly enrolled students to gain academic credit for knowledge they have acquired by self-study or experience. The student’s knowledge base is expected to parallel that of the specific UNL course for which the student wishes to gain credit. A fee of one-half of resident tuition is charged to administer and/or evaluate an examination for credit. Examinations for credit through UNL departments may be taken only by currently enrolled students. A student is not permitted to receive Credit by Examination in a course which is a prerequisite for a course already taken. Credit earned by examination is not applicable for use in an advanced degree program. Credit granted by another college for placement exams or locally designed test-out examinations will not be accepted in transfer. </span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">University of Nebraska–Lincoln students who earn credit at another institution</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Current UNL students are urged to consult with the appropriate academic adviser before enrolling in any course intended to be applied to the student’s degree. Non-UNL credit for Study Abroad programs will be evaluated as transfer credit upon receipt of official transcripts. Current UNL students who wish to enroll in a course at another institution in the NU System should file an Intercampus Application. http://admissions.unl.edu/apply/intercampus.asp</span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">University of Nebraska–Lincoln students who wish to transfer from one UNL college to another</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Current UNL students seeking to gain admission to another degree college must meet all standards for admission to the new college as a transfer applicant. The new college will evaluate all of the student’s credit, including transfer credit, to determine which credit will be applicable to degree requirements. </span></p>

				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Academic Adviser Assignment</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The University considers faculty contact with students essential to academic planning and University life. Undergraduate students are assigned academic advisers through the college or department in which they are majoring. Undergraduate students who have not yet decided upon a college will be referred to an academic adviser in the Division of General Studies.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Students Responsibilities in Academic Advising</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The University of Nebraska–Lincoln is committed to providing effective academic advising to students as an essential component of their educational experience.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Department and college advisers are assigned to students in their programs for assistance in assessing educational goals, planning programs of study, understanding program requirements, and following policies and procedures. Professional academic advisers in the Division of General Studies provide these services to students who have not yet declared their undergraduate college or major.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students are ultimately responsible for fulfilling all the requirements of the curriculum in which they are enrolled. Students are also responsible for initiating advising contacts and preparing for advising sessions. The mentoring relationship between academic advisers and students is confidential and is strengthened by advisers listening with understanding to student concerns.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students are expected to take responsibility for a successful university experience and effective advising session by:</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">1. Participating in New Student Enrollment and priority registration programs;</span></p>

				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">4. Identifying questions to address in advising sessions;</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">5. Informing advisers of any special needs, deficiencies or barriers that might affect academic success;</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">6. Following academic policies and procedures and meeting academic calendar deadlines (e.g. registration, fee payment, senior check/degree audit, filing for degree, etc.);</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">7. Knowing and completing degree or program requirements;</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">8. Monitoring their progress toward meeting degree requirements by maintaining a copy of their academic records and seeking assistance to resolve any errors or questions; and</span></p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="generated-style">9. Acting on recommendations to seek assistance from the various student support services provided by the University.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Maximum Credit Hour Load</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Undergraduate students may register for up to 18 credit hours per semester, except for the College of Business Administration which allows a maximum of 19 credit hours and the College of Arts and Sciences and the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts which allow a student to register for up to 20 credit hours. Written permission from the college dean is required to exceed the credit hour per semester maximum and must be filed with an Override Authorization Form at the time of registration.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Class Attendance</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students are expected to attend all lectures, recitations, quizzes, and laboratories regularly. The University has no regulation which permits cutting classes.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students are responsible for the attendance policy set by instructors and should clear absences directly with them.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">In cases where a student is unable to contact his or her instructors due to major illness, serious injury, or hospitalization or when given military orders which are effective immediately, a notice may be sent to the student’s instructors by the University Health Center, a family physician, or the Students Affairs Office, 106 Canfield Administration Building, 402-472-3755. This notice is for the instructor’s information only and does not relieve the student of contacting instructors as soon as possible.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Students involved in University-sponsored activities, including intercollegiate athletics, may need to be excused from a class, lab, or studio meeting. In all instances it is the student’s responsibility to request permission for the absence (preferably in writing) from the instructor and to discuss how the absence will affect their ability to meet the course requirements. Students should do this as soon in the semester as possible. While instructors should seek to the greatest extent possible, consistent with course requirements, to make reasonable accommodation for a student involved in University-sponsored activities, students should recognize that not every course can accommodate absences and neither the absence (nor the notification of an absence) relieves them from meeting the course requirements.</span></p>

				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Course prerequisites indicate the level of preparation a student must have had to take a given course. Equivalent preparation is generally sufficient. If there is doubt about a student’s preparation level, permission to enroll may be requested from the instructor of the course or from the department chairperson. Academic departments reserve the right to deny admission in a course if the prerequisite has not been completed. Academic departments reserve the right to give permission or waive the prerequisite for any course or to substitute for the prerequisite learning obtained by other means than through the prerequisite course(s). See the Courses of Instruction section for each undergraduate college in this bulletin for official listing of course prerequisites.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The use of the words “parallel”, “corequisite”, or “coregister with” in the prerequisite for a course means that both courses are to be taken simultaneously.</span></p>
				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Grading System</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The University uses an A through F grading system. The letter grades with point value (in parentheses) are: A+ (4.0), A (4.0), A- (3.67), B+ (3.33), B (3.0), B- (2.67), C+ (2.33), C (2.0), C- (1.67), D+ (1.33), D (1.0), D- (0.67), and F (0). Grades of W (dropped/withdrew), I (incomplete), P (pass/C or better), and N (no pass) may also be given. W, I, P, and N are not assigned grade points and therefore are not used in computation of a student’s grade point average.</span></p>

				<p class="title-2"><span class="generated-style">Grading Policies</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">University faculty members are expected to inform students early in the semester of course objectives, requirements, standards, and grading procedures for the particular course. In addition, they should make clear their individual policies regarding the Pass/No Pass grading option and the assignment of I (incomplete) grades. Failure of any faculty member to inform students of special restrictions in these areas could be grounds for a grade appeal case. Grade appeal procedures exist in all UNL undergraduate colleges (see Grade Appeals in individual undergraduate college sections of this bulletin).</span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">Pass/No Pass Grading Option</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The Pass/No Pass grading option was designed to enable students to take courses in areas of interest where they may feel they have had minimal preparation without adversely affecting their grade point average. Grades of P (pass) are interpreted as a grade of C or better. Neither grade P or N (no pass) contributes to the grade point average.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">There are collegiate restrictions on the use of this grading option. Students should see Pass/No Pass in individual undergraduate college sections of this bulletin, see the Schedule of Classes, and talk with their academic advisers concerning the use of this option.</span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">Grades of Incomplete</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The grade I is used by an instructor at the end of a term to designate incomplete work in a course. It should be used only when students are unable to complete the requirements of the course in the term in which they are registered because of illness, military service, hardship, or death in the immediate family. Incompletes should only be given if the student has already substantially completed the major requirements of the course.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">For complete procedures and regulations, see the Schedule of Classes and the Summer Sessions Bulletin.</span></p>
				<p class="title-3"><span class="generated-style">Course Repeat Policy</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">Only the most recent letter grade received in a given course will be used in computing a student’s cumulative grade point average if the student has completed the course more than once and previously received a grade or grades below C in that course.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">The previous grade (or grades) will not be used in computation of the cumulative grade point average, but it will remain a part of the academic record and will appear on any transcript.</span></p>
				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">A student can remove from his/her cumulative average a course grade of C-, D+, D, D-, or F if the student repeats the equivalent course at the University of Nebraska and receives a grade other than P (pass), I (incomplete), N (no pass), W (withdrew), or NR (no report).

				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style">In order to declare a semester bankrupt, all courses taken during the semester are bankrupt (both credit hours and grades). The bankrupt semester is removed from consideration for cumulative grade point average purposes and the bankrupt credit is not used for degree requirements. The semester listing of courses and grades remain evident on the academic record which is used to issue transcripts. A student may not bankrupt a semester after receiving a baccalaureate degree. College Independent Study via Extended Education and Outreach is not included in computing qualifying grade point averages; P grades may not be used to meet bankruptcy requirements.</span></p>

				<p class="basic-text"><span class="generated-style"> International Affairs offers a wide variety of overseas study opportunities to UNL undergraduate and graduate students for a semester, academic year, semester break, or summer period. With careful planning, credit earned during study abroad can be used toward degree requirements. Most programs can be arranged to complement regular degree programs. Credit earned on UNL and UNL-approved programs is considered resident credit for degree requirement purposes. In all cases, students register at UNL which means that most existing scholarships and financial aid remain in effect. A limited number of partial scholarships, reserved for participation in study abroad programs, are available. The cost of study for many programs is similar to regular tuition, room and board costs at UNL. More than 700 UNL students participate in study abroad each year. –INSERT LINK TO STUDY ABROAD</span></p>
