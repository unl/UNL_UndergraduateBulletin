The College is subdivided into units, each under the leadership of a chairperson, department head, or director.</p>
			<p class="content-box-m-p">ADMISSION</p>
			<p class="title-1">College Admission</p>
			<p class="title-2">College Entrance Requirements</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Students must have high school credit for (one unit is equal to one high school year):</p>
			<p class="list">1. 4 units of mathematics: 2 of algebra, 1 of geometry, 1 of precalculus and trigonometry.</p>
			<p class="list">2. 4 units of English.</p>
			<p class="list">3. 3 units of natural science that must include 1 unit of physics and 1 unit of chemistry (chemistry requirement waived for students in construction management).</p>
			<p class="list">4. 2 units of a single foreign language.</p>
			<p class="list">5. 3 units of social studies.</p>
			<p class="list">6. Students having a composite ACT score of 28 or greater (or equivalent SAT score) will be admitted to the College of Engineering even if they lack any one of the following: trigonometry, chemistry, or physics.</p>
			<p class="list">7. Students having an ACT score of 19 or less in English (or equivalent SAT score) must take ENGL 150 or ENGL 151.</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph">A total of 16 units is required for admission.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Students must have an ACT (enhanced) score of 24 or greater (or equivalent SAT). Students who lack entrance requirements may be admitted based on ACT scores, high school rank and credits, or may be admitted to pre-engineering status in the Exploratory and Pre-Professional Advising Center. Pre-engineering students are advised within the College of Engineering. </p>
			<p class="basic-text">Students who lack entrance units may complete precollege training by Independent Study through the UNL Office of On-line and Distance Education, in summer courses, or as a part of their first or second semester course loads while in the Exploratory and Pre-Professional Advising Center or other Colleges at UNL.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Students should consult their adviser, their department chair, or the Office of the Dean if they have questions on current policies.</p>
			<p class="title-1">Other Admission Requirements</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Students who transfer to the University of Nebraska–Lincoln from other accredited colleges or universities and wish to be admitted to the College of Engineering (COE) must meet COE freshman entrance requirements and have a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.5. Students not meeting either of these requirements must enroll in the Explore Center or another UNL college until they meet COE admission requirements. </p>
			<p class="basic-text">The COE accepts courses for transfer for which a C or better grade was received. Although UNL accepts D grades from the University of Nebraska at Kearney and at Omaha, not all majors in the COE accept such low grades. Students must conform to the requirements of their intended major and, in any case, are strongly encouraged to repeat courses with a grade of C- or less.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">All transfer students must adopt the curricular requirements of the undergraduate bulletin current at the time of transfer to the COE—not that in use when they entered UNL. Upon admission to UNL, students wishing to pursue degree programs in the COE will be classified and subject to the policies defined in the subsequent section.</p>

			<p class="title-1">Student Standing/Classification/Professional Admission</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Explore Center Pre-Engineering Students.</span> These are students who are not admitted to the College of Engineering due to admission deficiencies such as lack of high school mathematics, chemistry or physics course(s), ACT, or other qualifications. These students are administered in the Explore Center, but have academic advising available to them from the COE Dean’s Office. They may enroll in ENGR 10 and 100-level engineering courses provided they meet the prerequisites on a space-available basis. They must earn a 2.5 cumulative GPA in at least 12 credit hours and remove all entrance deficiencies to be admitted to the College of Engineering (COE).</p>
			<p class="basic-text">After being admitted to the COE, students wishing to pursue degree programs in the College of Engineering will be classified as described below.</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Provisional Engineering and Construction Management Students.</span> These are students who have been admitted to the College of Engineering and are in the process of establishing their academic credentials and confirming their choice of major. Transfer students from other colleges or universities, or from the Explore Center, will be classified as provisional for at least one semester (12 credits) while they confirm their career path and establish their academic credentials. Most students are on provisional status for one to four semesters. Provisional students may enroll in upper level engineering courses provided they meet the prerequisites, space is available, and no departmental restrictions exist.</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Regular Engineering and Construction Management Students.</span> These students may register in engineering courses where they meet all prerequisites or have permission. A regular student who wishes to transfer from one COE major to another must re-apply for professional admission to regular status in the new major, subject to the admission criteria of the new major.</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Restricted Students.</span> These students are those who enrolled in the Explore Center or in other colleges. Restricted students normally may enroll only in ENGR 10 and 100-level engineering courses. However, those with greater than a 2.5 cumulative GPA and no remaining entrance deficiencies may register in upper-level engineering courses, but only on a space-available basis in courses where they meet all prerequisites and have permission of the department. Restricted students may retake an engineering course for C-, D, and F removal no more than once, on a space-available basis and with permission. Restricted students may repeat courses with a previous withdrawal (W) only once. </p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">College Probation.</span> College probation is automatic for students who fall under the following circumstances</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-1">The cumulative GPA decreases to less than 2.5</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">A one-semester GPA less than 2.0</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">Failing or withdrawing from a given engineering course two or more times</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">Repeating three or more engineering courses</li>

			<p class="basic-text">Completion of the following semester (12 credits) with a semester GPA above 2.5 is required for a student to be removed from the college probation. Students may be placed on college probation (or dismissed) for violation of the UNL Student Code of Conduct at any time. A student cannot graduate from the College of Engineering while on college probation.</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">College Dismissal.</span> A student will be dismissed from the College of Engineering at the end of any semester in which:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-1">The student has been on college probation for two sequential semesters</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">The student is dismissed by UNL</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="header-paragraph">Students may also be dismissed for violating the UNL Student Code of Conduct at any time. College dismissal will cause an administrative change in the student’s matriculation to the Explore Center or to a college indicated by the student. Students who have been dismissed from the College of Engineering may be readmitted (one time only) provided they have removed all academic deficiencies that led to dismissal.</p>
			<p class="title-2">General College Policies</p>
			<p class="basic-text">These policies are applicable to all students in the College of Engineering:</p>

			<p class="list">2. Students may repeat a maximum of three engineering courses. Students may take any one engineering course a maximum of two times.</p>
			<p class="list">3. At least 30 of the last 36 credit hours needed for a degree must be registered for and completed at UNL or UNO while identified with the College of Engineering. This means that, practically speaking, the last year of a student’s work must be spent in residence. Credit earned during education abroad may be used toward degree requirements if students participate in prior approved programs and register through UNL (see http://educationabroad.unl.edu).</p>
			<p class="list">4. Pass/No Pass courses: Students in the College of Engineering must take ENGR 10, ENGR 20, ENGR 30, and ENGR 400 with the grading option Pass/No Pass. In addition, students may take up to 12 credit hours of courses in the humanities and social sciences on a Pass/No Pass basis. Students in the College of Engineering may not take any other required courses or technical elective courses with the grading option of Pass/No Pass.</p>
			<p class="list">5. Credits for “English for Foreign Students who are Non-native Speakers” at UNL and “English as a Second Language” at UNO are not applicable to degree programs in the College of Engineering.</p>
			<p class="list">6. Six hours of English composition may be substituted for the written communications requirement in all degree programs.</p>
			<p class="list">7. Students who enroll at UNL, UNO, or UNK under the academic year (Fall, Spring, Summer) of this bulletin must fulfill the requirements stated in this UNL bulletin or in any other UNL bulletin which is published while they are enrolled in the College, provided that the bulletin is no more than 10 years old at the time of graduation. A student must, however, meet the graduation requirements from one bulletin only. A student may not choose a portion from one bulletin and the remainder from another bulletin.</p>
