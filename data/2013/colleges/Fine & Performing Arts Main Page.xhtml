			<p class="content-box-h-1">ADVISING</p>
			<p class="title-1">Academic Advising</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Primary academic advising for students in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts is provided by the student’s home department or school. A faculty adviser is assigned by the department or school to help students plan their academic careers and select appropriate courses. Incoming freshmen are counseled during New Student Enrollment by specially trained advisers. Students are responsible for meeting with their academic advisers on a regular basis so that timely and appropriate counsel can be received. Students should contact their department or school office for more information on advising policies and procedures. The Dean’s Office is also available upon referral, but the department or school is the principal source for advising information.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Students wishing to include credits transferred from another institution in their program of study must submit a transcript to the UNL Office of Admissions. The Dean’s Office will complete an Evaluation of Transfer Credit form upon receipt of Courses Presented for Transfer from the Office of Admissions. <span class="basic-text-bold">Students who have previously had transfer credits evaluated in another UNL college must have the credits reevaluated upon entering the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts</span>.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">The applicability of transfer credits toward major requirements is determined by the department or school offering the major. Students who wish to apply transfer credits toward major requirements or who wish to request any waiver or substitution of requirements must complete a Request for Waiver or Substitution form. The Request for Waiver or Substitution must first be approved by the appropriate Chief Adviser (listed below) and department chair, before being forwarded to the Dean’s Office for final approval. Requests for waiver or substitution involving courses not offered by the student’s home department or school must have the approval (on the Request for Waiver or Substitution form) of the appropriate UNL department.</p>

			<p class="content-box-h-1">ACADEMIC PROGRAMS &amp; POLICIES</p>
			<p class="title-1">Academic Load</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Full-time status is attained by registering for twelve or more credits each semester. The Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts allows a maximum of 20 credits per semester.</p>
			<p class="title-1">Course Exclusions and Restrictions</p>
			<p class="basic-text">No credit for graduation is allowed for any course deemed to be high school-level (MATH 100A Intermediate Algebra, driver training education, etc.) or transfer credit from an institution with the primary purpose of vocational training (automotive repair, respiratory therapy, etc.).</p>
			<p class="basic-text">The current Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts policy regarding elective credit in ROTC and activity or athletics practice courses in nutrition and health sciences, College of Education and Human Sciences is:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list">1. Students majoring in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts may count no more than 10 hours credit in military science, naval science or aerospace studies courses toward their degree. Credit for courses taken beyond this limit will not count toward the credit hour requirements for a degree from the College. This restriction does not apply to courses cross listed between military science, naval science or aerospace studies and departments of the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list">2. Students majoring in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts may count no more than 4 hours credit (1 credit hour per semester) in activity or athletic practice courses, and/or basic military training toward their degree. Additional activity, athletic practice and basic military training courses may be taken, but the credit earned will not count toward a degree from the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list">3. A maximum total of 10 hours credit in activity, athletic practice, and basic military training courses and military science, naval science, or aerospace studies courses combined can be counted toward a degree in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts. This restriction does not apply to courses cross-listed between military science, naval science, or aerospace studies and departments of the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts.</p>
			<p class="title-1">Credit Rules</p>
			<p class="title-2">Credit by Examination</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Through study or experience that parallels a University of Nebraska–Lincoln course, a regularly enrolled University student may feel prepared to pass an examination on the course content of a specific course for credit in that course. To apply for credit, a student should:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list">1. Consult with the Department Chair.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list">2. Obtain a Credit by Examination Form at the Records Office, 107 Canfield Administration Building, 402-472-3649. Current enrollment in the University must also be verified.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list">3. Secure the approval signature from the Department Chair, instructor, and the Dean of the student’s college.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list">4. Secure the bursar’s receipt for payment of the appropriate fee per course for Credit by Examination. Currently, the fee is one-half the resident tuition rate.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list">5. Present the completed form to the instructor designated by the Department Chair. The instructor will give the examination and report the results on the Credit by Examination Form to the Records Office, 107 Canfield Administration Building, 402-472-3636.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Examination for credit through UNL departments may be taken only by currently enrolled students. A student is not permitted to receive Credit by Examination in a course which is a prerequisite for a course already taken unless the course and its prerequisites cover essentially different subject matter.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">The Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts also gives credit for the subject and general examinations of the College Level Examination Program and the Advanced Placement Program administered by the College Entrance Examination Board. See the Dean’s Office, 102 Woods Art Building, for current policy regarding CLEP and AP examinations.</p>
			<p class="title-1">Dual Degrees/Inter College Majors</p>
			<p class="title-2">Dual Degrees</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Students who wish to pursue two degrees at UNL must declare the additional degree on a Dual Matriculation form approved by both colleges involved. Generally, 30 credit hours will be added to the minimum number of credits needed to complete the secondary degree. Students in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts are allowed to declare two degrees within the college, provided that the degrees are different. Two degrees (diplomas) are awarded upon completion.</p>
			<p class="title-2">Inter-College Majors</p>
			<p class="basic-text">A student in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts pursuing a bachelor of arts degree may also complete a second bachelor of arts major in the College of Arts and Sciences. Likewise, a student in the College of Arts and Sciences pursuing a bachelor of arts degree may also complete a second bachelor of arts major in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts. The student must complete all degree requirements in the degree college in addition to the course work for the second major in the visiting college. One degree (diploma) will be awarded upon completion.</p>
			<p class="title-1">Honors Program</p>
			<p class="basic-text">The Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts encourages qualified students to participate in the University Honors Program. As far as their plans and programs permit, these students are enrolled in the special sections for superior students. In addition, departments in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts offer special honors sections of regular freshman courses to meet the needs of students with superior preparation in those subjects.</p>
			<p class="title-1">Student Recognition</p>
			<p class="title-2">Dean’s List</p>
			<p class="basic-text">The College recognizes students for academic achievement during the fall and spring semesters by placement on the College Dean’s List. To qualify for the Dean’s List in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts, students must complete 12 graded hours by the time of the first grade reports and attain a minimum semester grade point average of 3.7. The following do not qualify as part of the 12 credit hours: Pass/No Pass credit, transfer hours, removals of incompletes, and grade changes submitted after the census grade reports. Music education students are not eligible for the Dean’s List during the semester in which they are enrolled in MUED 497 (Student Teaching).</p>
			<p class="title-2">Degrees with Distinction</p>
			<p class="basic-text">In recognition of outstanding academic excellence, the College grants the bachelors degree with the designation of With Distinction, With High Distinction, and With Highest Distinction to qualified students. The College Academic Distinction and Awards Committee determines the level of distinction. To be recommended for distinction, candidates must fulfill the specific criteria for Highest Distinction, With High Distinction, or Distinction, as described below, in addition to all of the general criteria and procedures applicable to all distinction classifications.</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Highest Distinction.</span> Candidates for the bachelors degree may be awarded Highest Distinction on the basis of the following criteria: outstanding scholastic standing (a cumulative GPA above 3.9 as of the semester preceding graduation) and a thesis project of high quality.</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">High Distinction.</span> Candidates for the bachelors degree may be awarded High Distinction by fulfilling one of two sets of criteria: 1) by achieving outstanding scholastic standing (a cumulative GPA above 3.9 as of the semester preceding graduation), or 2) by achieving excellent scholastic standing (a cumulative GPA above 3.8 as of the semester preceding graduation) and a thesis project of high quality.</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Distinction.</span> Candidates for the bachelors degree may be awarded Distinction by achieving one of two sets of criteria: 1) by excellent scholastic standing (a cumulative GPA above 3.8 as of the semester preceding graduation), or 2) by achieving high scholastic standing (a cumulative GPA of 3.5 as of the semester preceding graduation) and a thesis project of high quality.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">The following criteria apply to all categories: an award of distinction on the basis of GPA alone (for Distinction or High Distinction) should not be considered automatic. In reviewing candidates, a consideration of the GPA is followed by an evaluation of the transcript, which includes: the general quality and breadth of the program, the quality of any transfer credit hours, the number of 300/400-level courses, the number of courses taken Pass/No Pass, and the number of courses retaken to remove D grades. Students must remove any incompletes by the end of the 8th week of classes in the term preceding graduation in order to be considered for recognition. In addition, ordinarily only students who have taken their last 48 hours of graded course work while registered in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts are considered. Consequently, it is possible for a student to have a GPA above the cut-off point and still not receive a recommendation for distinction. Also, graduation with any level of distinction is not automatic with the submission of a thesis project (a requirement for a degree with Highest Distinction, and an option for degrees with High Distinction or with Distinction). It does, however, make a student eligible to be considered for graduation with such honors.</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Thesis Project.</span> The thesis project should be substantially more extensive than a term paper. It must be the result of independent, sustained thought, and intellectual curiosity, and it must be completed outside of the structured assignments normally required for a course (excluding 499H courses). A survey of the literature about a particular topic is not sufficient. The project must include a significant written component. All of the following elements are required: 1) an abstract consisting of no more than one page; 2) a clear formulation of the problem, question, or project; 3) a scholarly study which illuminates it, and 4) a substantive conclusion supported by evidence. Students must write in a manner and style that can be understood by a non-specialist in the field. A bibliography and reference to existing literature in the field should be included where appropriate. The phrase “Thesis Project” acknowledges the possibility of having a scholarly honors endeavor which might not conform to the narrow definition of a “thesis”. The following are examples of previous Thesis Projects: 1) the arrangement of a particular symphony and a detailed description of the process of composing arrangements with literary references, 2) the creation of a portfolio of photographic works accompanied by a lengthy historical and literary background, 3) a complete set of costume designs with detailed information about the design, research and garment building process and photographs of the realized costumes. The project must have a significant written component, but it need not be in the format of a formal thesis.</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Procedure:</span> Students who elect to work on a thesis project must make arrangements before their senior year by consulting with a faculty member who will supervise the project. The student must register for an independent study course in their major area of study (499H) before proceeding with the preparation of the independent work. The Thesis Project Registration must be completed, with signatures, and filed in the Dean’s Office (102 Woods Art Building) by Tuesday of the second week of classes of the semester of graduation. The Thesis Project supervisor is expected to offer guidance to the student throughout the duration of the project. Two faculty members, the supervisor and the second reader, must complete a Thesis Project Evaluation Form. It is the responsibility of the faculty members to clearly address in their evaluations the extent to which the thesis project meets the three required elements listed above. Thesis projects and faculty evaluations must be submitted to the departmental unit head by the end of the 4th week of the semester of graduation. The unit heads signal departmental approval by forwarding the thesis project and faculty evaluations to the associate dean. Thesis projects not meeting the approval of the department will not be sent forward to the Dean’s Office for further consideration. The College Academic Distinction and Awards Committee conducts the final evaluation of the thesis project. Specific deadlines for each term are indicated on the Registration and Evaluation forms. Materials submitted after the stated deadlines will not be considered by the Academic Distinction and Awards Committee.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">In general, every thesis project is reviewed by the Committee. However, if no member of the Committee feels qualified in the subject area of the thesis project submitted, the Committee solicits the help of another faculty member with an appropriate background. This outside reader then submits to the Committee a formal written evaluation. Even so, members of the Committee must depend heavily on the faculty evaluations.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Students in the UNL Honors Program may submit an Honors Thesis, providing all of the above requirements and deadlines are met.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Students graduating in August must meet deadlines set for May graduates.</p>
			<p class="title-2">Dean’s Award for Academic Excellence</p>
			<p class="basic-text">This award is presented annually in the spring to the graduating student from the three graduations (May, August, and December) of the previous calendar year who has achieved the highest level of scholastic performance while in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts. The award is based on the final cumulative grade point average at graduation. In the event of a tie, other factors will be taken into consideration. It is expected that the last 48 hours of the student’s work will have been completed in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts.</p>
			<p class="title-1">International Study/Education Abroad</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Credit earned during education abroad may be used toward degree requirements if students participate in prior approved programs and register through UNL. Credit awarded from an institution other than UNL will be subject to transfer credit and residency rules.</p>
			<p class="title-1">Senior Check/Degree Audit</p>
			<p class="basic-text">During the second semester of the junior year or after completing 85 hours, students should apply for a degree audit in Graduation Services, 109 Canfield Administration Building.</p>
			<p class="title-1">Student Standing/Classification</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Sophomore Standing.</span> For admission to sophomore standing a student must have completed all of the College entrance requirements; earned a minimum of 27 semester hours of credit; and attained a total grade point average of at least 2.0.</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Junior Standing.</span> A student has junior standing after meeting the requirements for sophomore standing and completing 53 semester hours of credit.</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Senior Standing.</span> A student has senior standing after meeting the requirements for junior standing and completing 89 semester hours of credit.</p>
			<p class="title-1">Substitutions and Waivers</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Special requests concerning degree programs, including inquiries about exceptions to degree requirements, waivers, and substitutions should be made to the Dean’s Office, 102 Woods Art Building.</p>
			<p class="content-box-m-p">ACE REQUIREMENTS</p>
			<p class="basic-text">All students must fulfill the Achievement Centered Education (ACE) requirements. Information about the ACE program may be viewed at ace.unl.edu.</p>
			<p class="content-box-m-p">BULLETIN TO USE</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Students who first enroll at Nebraska under the 2012-2013 Undergraduate Bulletin must fulfill the requirements stated in this bulletin or in any other bulletin which is published while they are enrolled in the College provided the bulletin they follow is no more than ten years old at the time of graduation. A student must, however, meet the requirements from one bulletin only rather than choosing a portion from one bulletin and the remainder from another.</p>
			<p class="basic-text"><span class="basic-text-bold">Exception:</span> Students pursuing any degree in the School of Music who fail to take at least one course that will fulfill their degree requirements during a 12-month period must apply for re-admission. They are then required to move to the new bulletin and fulfill the requirements in effect at the time of readmission. </p>

			<p class="title-1">Minimum Hours Required for Graduation </p>
			<p class="basic-text">A minimum of 120 semester hours of credit is required for graduation from the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts. Students in the College are required to maintain a minimum current and cumulative GPA of 2.0. Individual departments may require a higher current and cumulative GPA.</p>
			<p class="title-1">Grade Rules </p>
			<p class="title-2">C- and D Grades </p>
			<p class="basic-text">The College will accept no more than 15 semester hours of grades lower than C from schools outside of the University of Nebraska system. </p>
			<p class="basic-text">Grades lower than C earned at UNL or transferred from other schools cannot be applied toward requirements in a major, but may be applied toward total hours.</p>
			<p class="title-2">Pass/No Pass Limits</p>
			<p class="basic-text">University regulations for the Pass/No Pass privilege state: The Pass/No Pass option is designed to be used by a student seeking to expand his/her intellectual horizons by taking courses in areas where he/she may have minimum preparation without adversely affecting his/her grade point average.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list">1. Neither the P nor the N grade contribute to a student’s GPA</p>
			<p class="numbered-list">2. P is interpreted to mean C or above. Some professional education courses require a C+ or above.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list">3. A change to or from Pass/No Pass may be made until mid-term (1/2 of the course.) This date coincides with the final date to drop a course without the instructor’s approval.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list">4. The Pass/No Pass or grade registration cannot conflict with the professor’s, department’s, college, or University policy governing grading option.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list">5. Prior to the mid-term deadline, changing to or from the Pass/No Pass requires using the MyRED system to change the grading option or filing a Drop/Add form with the Office of the University Registrar, 107 Canfield Administration Building. After the mid-term deadline, a student registered for Pass/No Pass cannot change to a grade registration unless the Pass/No Pass registration is in conflict with a professor’s, department’s, college, or University policy governing Pass/No Pass.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list">6. The Pass/No Pass grading option cannot be used for the removal of C- or D or F grades.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Pass/no pass privileges in the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts are extended to students according to the following additional regulations:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list">1. Pass/no pass hours can count toward fulfillment of ACE requirements up to the 24-hour maximum.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list">2. Freshmen and sophomores may enroll for no more than 6 hours of Pass/No Pass work per semester.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list">3. Students may not elect to take courses on a Pass/No Pass basis to fulfill degree requirements in the major. Departments may allow up to 6 hours of Pass/No Pass to be taken in the minor offered by the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list">4. Departments may specify that certain courses can be taken only on a Pass/No Pass basis.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list">5. The College will permit no more than a total of 24 semester hours of Pass/No Pass grades to be applied toward degree requirements. This total includes all “pass” grades earned at UNL and other schools.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Individual departments vary in their policies regarding Pass/No Pass hours as applied to the major and minor. Consult the individual departmental listings for these policies. Students who wish to apply Pass/No Pass hours to their major and minor(s) must obtain approval on a form that is available in the Dean’s Office, 102 Woods Art Building.</p>
			<p class="title-2">GPA Requirements</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Students are expected to maintain a minimum 2.0 grade point average each semester. Some programs within the College may have higher GPA requirements to keep in good academic standing.</p>
			<p class="title-1">Transfer Credit Rules</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Ordinarily, hours earned at an accredited college are accepted by the University. The College, however, will evaluate all hours submitted on an application for transfer and reserves the right to accept or reject any of them. The maximum number of hours the University will accept on transfer from a two-year college is 60.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Normally credit is not given for pre-university work. In some instances, however, it may be possible to receive credit through satisfactory examination.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">All transfer students must complete the Residency Requirement (see “Residency Requirement”), and at least 9 hours in the major field must be completed at the University regardless of the number of hours transferred.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">The Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts will accept no more than 15 semester hours of D grades from schools other than UNO or UNK. All grades may be transferred from UNO or UNK. However, transfer courses within a student’s major or minor will be evaluated by that unit and held to the same minimum grade standards as courses taken at UNL.</p>
			<p class="title-2">Department of Art and Art History Transfer Credit Policy</p>
			<p class="basic-text">A studio art or art history course presented for possible transfer to UNL is evaluated by the Department of Art and Art History using course descriptions and/or course syllabi to evaluate content, and course schedules to evaluate the hours of instruction.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Studio art courses that are eligible for transfer credit based on course content are awarded one credit hour for every 30 hours of instruction (with the assumption that the transfer course required 15 hours of work outside of class for every 30 hours spent in class with the instructor.) Credit is rounded to the nearest half-credit hour. If a course is presented for possible transfer, and the hours of instruction fall short of UNL’s NASAD-based standards, the course will receive a proportional reduction in credit. </p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">BFA –</span> At least 36 credit hours in studio art and 9 credit hours in art history of the required BFA courses must be taken at UNL. Courses taken at other academic institutions may be substituted for the remaining required courses subject to evaluation by the department.</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">BA in Studio Art –</span> At least 12 credit hours in studio art and 9 credit hours in art history of the required BA courses must be taken at UNL. Courses taken at other academic institutions may be substituted for the remaining required courses subject to evaluation by the department.</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">BA in Art History – </span>At least 18 credit hours of the required art history courses must be taken at UNL. Courses taken at other academic institutions may be substituted for the remaining required courses subject to evaluation by the department.</p>
			<p class="title-2">School of Music Transfer Credit Policy</p>
			<p class="basic-text">The following will be used by advisers as guidelines for the evaluation of transfer credits which are <span class="basic-text-bold">less than five years old</span>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-1">If a transfer student has successfully completed (grade C or above) approved transfer credits which are <span class="basic-text-bold">equivalent</span> to music major/minor requirements in terms of number of credit hours and scope of content, that area will be considered completed at the discretion of the chief degree program adviser.</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">For approved transfer credits which are <span class="basic-text-bold">lacking equivalency</span> in either number of credit hours, scope of content, or grade received to music major/minor requirements in applied music, music theory, sight singing/aural skills, and keyboard skills, the number of transfer credits accepted and placement will be determined by audition/proficiency tests administered by designated area faculty.</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">For approved transfer credits which are <span class="basic-text-bold">lacking equivalency</span> in other music areas (history and ensembles), the number of transfer credits accepted will be determined by the chief degree program adviser.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="basic-text">All music course work which is <span class="basic-text-bold">more than five years old</span> must be validated by an audition or competency examination given by designated area faculty.</p>

			<p class="basic-text">There are no additional restrictions regarding transfer credit.</p>
			<p class="title-2">Transfer Credit from Foreign Institutions</p>
