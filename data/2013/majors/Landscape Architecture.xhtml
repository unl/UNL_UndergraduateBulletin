			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The primary responsibility of the landscape architecture profession is the design and stewardship of the built and natural environments. Therefore, landscape architects must be able to understand the process of nature and the impact human settlement has on ecosystems. This requires professionals to manage storm water, select appropriate plant material, and anticipate human impact all with an eye on a sustainable future.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The landscape architecture program seeks to increase students’ capacity for critical thinking, collaborative skills, and creative potential in service to the environment and humanity. Specifically, the curriculum provides the background and means for the student to:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list" xml:lang='en-us'>1. Analyze and understand the relationship between humanity and the natural world it inhabits;</p>
			<p class="numbered-list" xml:lang='en-us'>2. Creatively explore the potential of interventions into the developed and underdeveloped environments;</p>
			<p class="numbered-list" xml:lang='en-us'>3. Search out new challenges and contribute to solutions through research and experimentation; and</p>
			<p class="numbered-list" xml:lang='en-us'>4. Participate in the community that makes decisions affecting the physical environment.</p>
			<p class="title-1" xml:lang='en-us'>General</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The landscape architecture program is a five-year course of study that has been subdivided into a two-year pre-professional, two-year para-professional, and a one-year professional degree unit. Students receive a bachelor of science in design (BSD) at the end of the two two-year segments and a professional bachelor of landscape architecture (BLA) at the end of the fifth year. At the end of the first two year pre-professional segment, students are required to apply for admission into the professional segment of the curriculum. This review involves an evaluation of the students academic record and a portfolio of their work during the preprofessional studies. The landscape architecture program is a candidate program for accreditation. It is anticipated it will be granted for all students as soon as it is allowed under the rules of accreditation defined by the Landscape Architectural Accreditation Board (LAAB).</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Students are required to take an array of courses in support of the core studio sequence in addition to the university’s general education courses. These courses include material in horticulture, architecture, planning, and engineering in addition to core landscape architecture classes. This curriculum exposes students to various issues facing the landscape architecture profession including plant material, soils, landscape ecology, construction issues, stormwater management, infrastructure and issues created by urbanism. </p>
			<p class="content-box-h-1" xml:lang='en-us'>ADMISSION</p>
			<p class="title-1" xml:lang='en-us'>Admission to the Landscape Architecture Program</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>After completion of the first two years of pre-landscape architecture studies, either within the College of Architecture or at another institution, students may apply for admission to the architecture program.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Pre-landscape architecture majors should apply for admission to the professional program in landscape architecture. Successful applicants will have their major changed from pre-landscape architecture to BSD-Landscape Architecture option.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Available teaching resources and space capacities limit enrollment to the third year of architectural studies; therefore enrollment limits are established each semester.</p>
			<p class="title-2" xml:lang='en-us'>Minimum Entrance Requirements</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>To be considered for admission to the landscape architecture program, applicants must:</p>
			<p class="numbered-list" xml:lang='en-us'>1. Be enrolled in the College of Architecture</p>
			<p class="numbered-list" xml:lang='en-us'>2. Be in good scholastic standing</p>
			<p class="numbered-list" xml:lang='en-us'>3. Have completed the 1st and 2nd year pre-<span class="no-style-override">landscape architecture program</span> of study</p>
			<p class="title-1" xml:lang='en-us'>Third-Year Admission Process</p>
			<p class="numbered-list" xml:lang='en-us'>1. An application for admission may be completed by filling out the online application. The Program receives applications once a year in early February.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list" xml:lang='en-us'>2. Applicants must submit a portfolio conforming to the defined criteria for the program applied for by the date posted at the completion of the spring semester.</p>
			<p class="numbered-list" xml:lang='en-us'>3. Any applicant who has previously applied for admission and has not been accepted or who fails to enroll in the professional program in architecture after an acceptance must reapply in the regular manner. Students may apply for admission to the <span class="no-style-override">landscape architecture program</span> only three times.</p>
			<p class="title-2" xml:lang='en-us'>Evaluation</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>A faculty committee of the program will carefully evaluate the applications for admission. The committee considers three elements in their evaluation; cumulative grade point average, a weighted grade point average, and the portfolio of student work. The weighted grade point average gives additional value to the applicant’s achievement in the required LARC prefix course or transfer equivalents in the pre-professional curriculum.</p>
			<p class="title-2" xml:lang='en-us'>Selection</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Admission to the landscape architecture program will be awarded to applicants who show the greatest professional potential and have demonstrated scholastic achievement. The faculty reserves the right to not fill all available spaces in the professional program in landscape architecture if it determines that the remaining applicants have not performed at an acceptable level.</p>
			<p class="title-1" xml:lang='en-us'>Admission to the 1-Year Bachelor of Landscape Architecture Program</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Students from both inside and outside the program must apply to gain admission to the 1-year BLA degree program. Applications are available in October from the department office and are reviewed once a year in February.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="basic-text-bold">All applications for admission are subject to approval of the faculty. Enrollment shall be limited by the teaching resources and space capacities of the program. An enrollment quota is established prior to each admissions cycle.</span></p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Students in the professional program are governed by the rules, procedures and policies established in the landscape architecture program. These are published in the Student Guide or by official notification by the faculty.</p>
			<p class="title-2" xml:lang='en-us'>Minimum Entrance Requirements</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>To be considered for admission to the BLA Professional Program in Landscape Architecture, applicants must:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-1">Have a 4-year degree from an accredited landscape program or its equivalent as determined by the program director</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">Present a portfolio of design work</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">Be in good scholastic standing</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">Have a B average or its equivalent in past academic programs</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The faculty of the landscape architecture program require a minimum TOEFL score of 550 or 213 computer-based or 79-80 Internet-based score for all international student applicants whose first language is not English.</p>
			<p class="title-2" xml:lang='en-us'>Evaluation</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>A portfolio of an applicant’s recent design work will be evaluated by the faculty of the landscape architecture program and is considered to be a very important part of the application review process, along with the applicant’s educational profile, letters of recommendation (required for outside applicants only), transcripts, and application form.</p>
			<p class="title-2" xml:lang='en-us'>Selection</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The limited number of spaces available each semester will be awarded to applicants who have displayed the highest abilities in a combination of scholastic achievement, design capability, and professional potential.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The Admissions Committee reserves the right to reject applicants who, in its opinion, have not reached an acceptable level of design proficiency.</p>
			<p class="content-box-h-1" xml:lang='en-us'>MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
			<p class="title-1" xml:lang='en-us'>Specific Major Requirements</p>
			<p class="title-2" xml:lang='en-us'>Pre-Landscape Architecture Curriculum</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The pre-landscape curriculum begins with a two-year basic design core. This core introduces students to visual literacy and design fundamentals. The pre-landscape architecture program is followed by two years of focused landscape architecture instruction leading to a bachelor of science in design. After receipt of the bachelors degree, students may continue with one additional year of study, leading to a professional bachelor of landscape architecture degree. The professional bachelor of landscape architecture degree is the degree accredited by the Landscape Architectural Accreditation Board (LAAB). UNL’s BLA Program currently has “candidacy” accreditation status from LAAB.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The College of Architecture, and all five years of the architecture program, are located in Lincoln. However, we do offer the option to do the first two years of the program at UNO. After successfully completing the prescribed pre-landscape architecture program at UNO, students may transfer to UNL and apply for admission to the third year of study in the professional program of the College of Architecture.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>For more information about courses at UNO, or transferring from UNO to UNL, please contact us.</p>
