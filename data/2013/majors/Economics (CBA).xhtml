			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Economic analysis is useful in many decisions made by individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and governments. In addition to opportunities in teaching, economists are employed in many branches of government and on the staffs of corporations in manufacturing, insurance, banking, brokerage, and financial services. Economists often serve as consultants, either individually or in consulting firms. Today’s economists deal with problems ranging from monetary and fiscal policy, monopoly and competition, environmental improvement, labor relations, regional development, urban reconstruction, economic development and international business and finance. Economics is also a popular major for students planning to enter professional and graduate programs, particularly in law, foreign service, labor relations, or business administration.</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph" xml:lang='en-us'>The Department of Economics offers the opportunity for intensive study in twelve specialized economic areas: </p>

			<p class="header-paragraph" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="header-paragraph-title">Comparative International and Regional Development. </span>Examines how human capital, fiscal policy, natural features, and industry clusters influence the comparative advantage, growth, and standard of living in urban and regional economies between and within countries. </p>
