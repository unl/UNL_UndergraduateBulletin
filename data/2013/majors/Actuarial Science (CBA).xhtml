			<p class="basic-text">An actuary is a mathematically-oriented business person who will most likely be a manager or supervisor at some point in his/her career. Thus, a course of study culminating in a bachelor of science degree in business administration with a major in actuarial science is an excellent educational background for prospective actuaries. Additional information is available at www.BeAnActuary.org.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">The actuarial science program is designed to prepare students for the current industry demands. Because the demands change on a regular basis, often times, the number of hours, the sequencing of courses, and the specific requirements change for this major. Students should continue to consult with the department for the appropriate selection and listing of course requirements.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">The actuarial science program is proud to have been named one of the first Centers of Actuarial Excellence by the Society of Actuaries.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">All actuarial science students are encouraged to visit the actuarial science program’s website (http://cba.unl.edu/academics/actuarial/) and an actuarial science program faculty adviser for more information about the program, including the Actuarial Science Club, sequencing of courses, scholarship opportunities, and the requirements for achieving professional actuarial designations.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">In addition, because of the mathematical orientation for this program, actuarial science majors are required to make some modifications to the degree program requirements. These requirements (with a reminder that all required course work must be taken for a grade) are noted below.</p>
			<p class="content-box-h-1">ADMISSION</p>
			<p class="title-1">Major/Department Admission</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Admission requirements for all majors in the College are the same as those for University Admission as noted under UNL General Admission Requirements.</p>
			<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
			<p class="title-1">Core Requirements</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-1"> In addition to the College Degree Requirements, students will complete 28 hours of course work for the major.</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">As noted in the College Degree Requirements section, all course work for the major must be taken for a grade. Actuarial science majors must take MATH 106, MATH 107, and MATH 208, as well as CSCE 101 &amp; CSCE 101L.</li>
				<li class="bullet-2">These hours have been built into the College Degree Requirements as part of the Non-Business Requirements (NBR).</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">ACTS 399/499 may not count toward the major or minor in actuarial science.</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">Other College Degree Requirement changes for actuarial science majors includes:</li>
				<li class="bullet-2">ACTS majors must take STAT 380 in place of ECON 215 for the Business Core Foundation (BCF) requirements.</li>
				<li class="bullet-2">ACTS majors will also take STAT 462 &amp; STAT 463 Introduction to Mathematical Statistics I &amp; II for the Business Core Foundation (BCF) requirements.</li>
				<li class="bullet-2">ACTS majors will take FINA 461 Advanced Finance in place of FINA 361 for the Business Core Intermediate (BCI) requirements; the prerequisite of FINA 361 (for FINA 363 and FINA 461) is satisfied with completion of ACTS 440.</li>
				<li class="bullet-2">12 hours of 300/400-level elective course work is NOT required for actuarial science majors. </li>
				<li class="bullet-2">As part of the college <span class="basic-text-bold">elective</span> requirements, all students complete ONE business elective course for the program. ACTS majors are WAIVED from this specific requirement; however, all ACTS majors must take an IBCR course and thus, this can be done to meet the business elective requirement. The department suggests FINA 450 International Financial Management be taken to meet the requirement. An alternative option is to take ECON 321 or MNGT 428 as part of NBR 6–ACE 9 which then double counts for both the NBR 6 and IBCR requirement. </li>
			</ul>
			<p class="title-1">Specific Major Requirements</p>
			<p class="title-2">Business Core Advanced–Major (BCA-M)</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Requirements for students interested in pursuing the bachelor of science degree with a major in actuarial science will complete 28 hours of actuarial science course work for the Business Core Advanced-Major (BCA-M): </p>

			</ul>
			<p class="title-1">Tracks/Options/Concentrations/Emphases Requirements</p>
			<p class="basic-text"> While not required, actuarial science majors may double major in finance. The finance department allows double counting of courses for students choosing to obtain a double major in actuarial science and finance. </p>

			<p class="requirement-sec-4">i. Also, consider choosing FINA 450 as one of the 400-level options to meet the requirement for the major as well as a requirement for the IBCR.</p>
			<p class="requirement-sec-3">b. For all other options within the finance major, the required and elective finance courses are the same as those of a student obtaining just the finance major. </p>
			<p class="title-3">Finance Minor</p>
