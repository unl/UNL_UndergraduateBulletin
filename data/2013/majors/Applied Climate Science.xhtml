			<p class="basic-text">The degree program in applied climate science is designed to educate students in basic and applied sciences related to meteorology and climatology. The ACS major will provide a foundation for understanding the climate system and its components, as well as interactions of the climate system components with, and impacts on, the environment and human societies. The new program will provide education and training needed to address applied climate science issues such as climate change.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">The goal is to allow meteorology and climatology students to obtain a higher level of training in climatology in order to understand complex climate-based problems and their interrelationships with natural resources and ecosystem management issues that are pervasive today and will become even more important in the future. Issues such as natural hazard management, climate change, changing frequency and severity of extreme climate events, environmental degradation, deforestation, and increased demand for water and other natural resources are at the root of this increased demand for trained professionals. </p>
			<p class="basic-text">The undergraduate major will provide students with several career options upon completion of their degree. Opportunities include positions with environmental consulting firms, planning agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and governmental agencies addressing climate issues, or fulfillment of a pre-professional degree requirement. The program also provides students the opportunity to prepare for graduate study in applied climate sciences and other related fields.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">A minimum of 120 credit hours is required for the bachelor of science degree. Of these requirements, 32 credits are in an applied climate sciences curriculum designed to provide the foundation in meteorology and climatology. The applied climate science degree program also requires 30 credit hours of science and mathematics. Students must select a specialization consisting of 22-23 credit hours, allowing students to develop an individualized area of study; the specialization is designed by the student in consultation with an adviser. Possible focus areas include but are not limited to Agroecosystems, Geospatial Techniques, Hazard Assessment, Human Dimensions and Environmental Policy, Livestock and Wildlife, and Water Resources. To complete the degree, the student must take 21 credit hours of communication, humanities and social science courses. </p>
