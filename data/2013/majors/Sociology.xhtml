			<p class="basic-text">A major of sociology within the College of Arts and Sciences is a flexible program. The sociology curriculum provides students with many valuable skills, including learning to think objectively and creatively, to write and speak effectively, to analyze data, and to more fully appreciate and understand social and cultural differences among people. Course choices may be made with respect to a student’s interests and educational objectives. Students may pursue broad training in sociology or may pursue a focus area that meets their objectives.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Current majors and students considering a major in sociology should consult with a department adviser when registering for classes. This is particularly important because the subjects that lay the foundation for later training in sociology, plus the courses for a minor in another department, should be carefully selected. The adviser can also discuss focus areas, internships, and research opportunities.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">This department participates in the programs of Global Studies, Ethnic Studies, Environmental Studies, the Center for Great Plains Studies, and the Women’s and Gender Studies Program.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">One course in rural sociology, AECN 276, may count toward a major in sociology. Students in the College of Agriculture who have taken AECN 276 may substitute the course for SOCI 101 if they plan to take other courses in the Department of Sociology.</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Work.</span> The advanced degrees of master of arts and doctor of philosophy are offered. For details of these programs, see the <span class="basic-text-ital">Graduate Studies Bulletin</span> and the departmental bulletin, Sociology Graduate Program Guidelines, available at 711 Oldfather Hall.</p>

			<p class="basic-text">Results of participation in these assessment activities will not affect a student’s GPA or graduation in any way.</p>
