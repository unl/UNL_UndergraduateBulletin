			<p class="basic-text">The music major is available in two degree programs. Both include the opportunity to take applied lessons with highly acclaimed faculty artists and scholars, as well as a compulsory foundation in music theory and history, keyboard skills, and ensemble participation.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Students choosing the bachelor of arts degree can expect a substantial amount of musical study encompassing about three years. This degree offers a choice between two options: a) a performance track, or b) a research track. The performance track will culminate with a recital normally given during the sixth (and last) semester of study. The research track will culminate in the presentation of a final research project or document. Both the research and the performance options require that a minor area of study be included in the program of studies.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Students wishing to take a course of study in music that will prepare them for graduate study and eventually a professional career in music theory, music history, composition, piano pedagogy, or performance, should take a bachelor of music degree. The bachelor of music degree is recommended for students who have the desire and capacity to reach high standards of achievement in performance study. Students with creative talent may pursue courses in composition and develop their abilities as composers. Music scholars will want to increase their understanding of the history and/or theory of music by pursuing an emphasis in music history or music theory. The performance emphases include eight successive semesters of applied lessons and culminate with a senior recital.</p>

			<p class="content-box-h-1">ADDITIONAL MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
			<p class="title-1">Requirements for Continuing Study Toward a Music Degree</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Music majors are required to demonstrate adequate skills in applied music, functional keyboard, theory and sight singing before they may continue toward the completion of a degree in music. The following prerequisites are in place to secure this requirement.</p>
			<p class="title-2">Applied Music–Upper Divisional Qualifying Jury</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Music majors must pass the <span class="basic-text-bold">Upper Divisional Qualifying Jury</span> (UDQJ) to be admitted into 300-level applied music. The UDQJ is usually taken in the fourth semester of applied study.</p>
			<p class="title-3">Part I – Basic Skills</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Faculty evaluate the student’s minimal capabilities, including the ability to sight read and perform scales and arpeggios, to determine if the student may continue as a music major.</p>
			<p class="title-3">Part II - Musicianship</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Faculty evaluate the student’s performance to determine if the student may continue as a music major.</p>
			<p class="title-3">Evaluation</p>
			<p class="basic-text">The UDQJ is judged Pass/No Pass, with pass meaning that the student’s basic musical skills and musicianship are judged to be at least minimal for his/her instrument. The jury members in each area will use a general consensus approach in determining Pass/No Pass. A no pass on the UDQJ will indicate an interpretation by the faculty that the student has not completed the requirements for the Upper Divisional Qualifying Jury, resulting in a formal grade of <span class="basic-text-bold">incomplete</span>. The student then has two additional juries to remove the incomplete. The student may continue to register for applied study at the 200 level for a maximum of two semesters until the incomplete is removed. After one year, the incomplete will expire, causing the grade to revert to a D or F. If the student passes the re-take before the beginning of the 2nd week of classes, he/she will be permitted to register for 300-level applied music courses for that semester.</p>
			<p class="basic-text"><span class="basic-text-bold">NOTE:</span> A re-examination will be scheduled only during the first week of classes following a semester in which the UDQJ was failed or during regular scheduled jury times at the end of a semester.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">The status of music major is provisional, pending a satisfactory completion of the UDQJ. The result of the UDQJ is validated on the <span class="basic-text-bold">UDQJ JURY</span> form with faculty signatures, and filed in the music office.</p>
			<p class="title-1">Grade Rules </p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-1">All courses taken to fulfill music major or minor requirements must be taken for a grade (except those only offered as Pass/No Pass). </li>
				<li class="bullet-1">Students must earn grades of C or better in these courses. Any course in which a student earns a grade of C- or below must be repeated in order to count toward the requirement.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="title-1">Extended Education, Independent Study Rules, Internship Credit Rules, Transfer Credit used in Major Requirements</p>
