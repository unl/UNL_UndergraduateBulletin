			<p class="basic-text">The Department of Biochemistry offers studies leading to either a bachelor of science (BS) or to a combined bachelors and masters degree (BS and MS) in biochemistry. The training offered is suitable for a professional career in biochemistry, which may lead to employment in various industries involved in the manufacture or processing of chemicals, foods, feeds, and pharmaceuticals; or federal agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Public Health Service, and Environmental Protection Agency. The program is also suitable as preparation for graduate studies leading to academic careers in biochemistry and professional careers in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, pharmacy, and health-related fields.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">The combined bachelors and masters degree in biochemistry is especially tailored for highly motivated undergraduate students with superior ability who seek additional training to further their career goals. This research thesis-based program is designed to provide opportunities to students to carry out and interpret contemporary research.</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Work.</span> Advanced degrees of master of science and doctor of philosophy are available through the Center for Biological Chemistry. For details, consult the Graduate Studies Bulletin.</p>
			<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Laboratory Fee and Deposit.</span> Students who enroll in laboratory courses in the Department of Biochemistry may be required to pay a small nonrefundable cash fee to defray the cost of materials consumed in the course and a deposit to cover the cost of replacing or repairing equipment the student may damage in the laboratory.</p>
