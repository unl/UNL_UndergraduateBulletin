			<p class="basic-text">Jewish Studies is an interdisciplinary program housed in the Norman and Bernice Harris Center for Judaic Studies, 324 Seaton Hall. The minor in Jewish Studies is for students of diverse disciplinary backgrounds who are interested in Jewish cultures and peoples, past and present; the ways in which Judaism and other religious traditions have influenced each other, Near Eastern and Middle Eastern history and politics; and/or the origins and effects of anti-Semitism and other forms of discrimination. Courses in Jewish Studies are offered by cooperating faculty in departments in the College of Arts and Sciences including: anthropology, classics, English, history, modern languages and literatures, philosophy, political science, psychology, religious studies, and sociology. Language courses in Biblical Hebrew are available. Students minoring in Jewish Studies are eligible for several scholarships awarded by the Harris Center for Judaic Studies.</p>
