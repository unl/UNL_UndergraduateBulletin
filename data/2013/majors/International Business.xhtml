			<p class="content-box-h-1">DESCRIPTION</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Students in international business study the business practices of other nations and learn how international trade laws affect the world economy. A background in international business will help students become a better member of the management team of any corporation. From banks to manufacturing firms, an increasing number of industries need professionals who understand the world’s business environment. Import and export firms, agricultural commodities firms, and government and non-government agencies may specifically seek international expertise. It is suggested that students begin thinking about where they want to study abroad and their language and culture courses during the freshman year. Upper-level course work and education abroad experience will be done sometime in the junior or senior year.</p>
			<p class="basic-text">Because the nature of the major requires studying abroad and careful selection of course work to complement and count for appropriate requirements, students are strongly encouraged to consult with their adviser or a staff member in the Undergraduate Programs Office. </p>
			<p class="basic-text">In order for students to be successful in international business after graduation, they should plan to do the following as part of their university experience:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="bullet-1">Internships related to international business</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">Involvement with international student groups</li>
				<li class="bullet-1">Language study</li>
