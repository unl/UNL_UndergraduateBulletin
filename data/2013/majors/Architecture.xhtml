			<p class="faculty-list" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="faculty-list-bold">Chief Advisers:</span> Pre-Architecture: Leslie Brehm (lbrehm2@unl.edu) and Stephanie Kuenning (skuenning2@unl.edu); Architecture: Assigned faculty </p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The primary responsibility of the architectural profession is the design of meaningful, productive environments for human occupation and use. Architects, therefore, must be able to understand the needs and desires of the people who will inhabit and use their creations and then effectively synthesize the complex structural, mechanical, constructional components, and cultural references that go into the design of a building. As designers, they must possess both creative and aesthetic skills as well as technical knowledge.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The architecture program seeks to increase students’ desire to learn and to develop a capacity for design-thinking and sound, critical judgment while simultaneously developing their creative potential. Specifically, the curriculum provides the background and means for the student to:</p>
			<p class="list" xml:lang='en-us'>1. Analyze and understand society’s needs and desires,</p>
			<p class="list" xml:lang='en-us'>2. Translate these needs and desires into a physical form and spatial organization,</p>
			<p class="list" xml:lang='en-us'>3. Contribute creatively to the building construction industry,</p>
			<p class="list" xml:lang='en-us'>4. Search out new problems and contribute to environmental knowledge through research,</p>
			<p class="list" xml:lang='en-us'>5. Initiate and review changes in technology and society, and</p>
			<p class="list" xml:lang='en-us'>6. Participate in the community that makes decisions affecting the physical environment.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Architecture is a six-year course of study divided into a pre-professional year and a professional program of study. Students choosing to study architecture first enter the College as majors in pre-architecture. After completing a one year introductory design curriculum common to all undergraduates in the College of Architecture, students apply for admission into the architecture program’s professional program. The professional program in architecture consists of two components: the three-year <span class="basic-text-bold">bachelor of science in design </span>(BSD-Architecture) and the subsequent two-year <span class="basic-text-bold">master of architecture</span> (MArch).</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Students in good standing at the completion of the BSD-Architecture are admitted to the MArch program without application.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>In the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accreditation Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture, recognizes three types of degrees: the bachelor of architecture, the master of architecture and the doctor of architecture. A program may be granted a 6-year, 3-year, or 2-year term of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational standards.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Masters degree programs may consist of an undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree, that, when earned sequentially, constitute an accredited professional education. However, the undergraduate degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'><span class="basic-text-bold">The bachelor of science in design is a para-professional degree and a necessary component of the professional program which culminates with the master of architecture degree. The master of architecture degree is the first professional degree. </span>The professional master of architecture degree is fully accredited by the National Architectural Accreditation Board (NAAB).</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>In addition to the normal two-year professional program, <span class="basic-text-bold">applicants with degrees from other fields may be eligible to enter the three year master of architecture program with deficiencies.</span><span class="no-style-override"> </span>These deficiencies are evaluated by the program director on an individual basis after admission resulting from a review of the applicant’s transcripts and other pertinent professionally-related materials by the Student Affairs Committee. Students in this three year program are required to complete 27 to 50 hours of selected undergraduate courses (a minimum of one additional year) prior to pursuing the professional program. Applicants with deficiencies exceeding 50 credit hours are not admitted.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>For those who would like to pursue scholarship in architecture, the architecture program also offers a 36 credit hour, scholarly-nonprofessional <span class="basic-text-bold">master of science in architecture degree for students with a bachelors degree in architecture or a related discipline</span>.</p>
			<p class="title-1" xml:lang='en-us'>The Master of Architecture Professional Program</p>
			<p class="title-2" xml:lang='en-us'>General</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The professional program in architecture is a six-year course of study that includes a one-year pre-professional segment, a three-year core segment culminating in the award of the bachelor of science in design (BSD) and culminates in the final two-year exploratory segment which results in the receipt of the professional master of architecture degree (MArch).</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Although the bachelor of science in design degree is an integral part of the five-year professional program in architecture, it should be clearly understood that the undergraduate BSD is not a professional degree and is not accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board. Most state registration boards will not acknowledge any degree unless accompanied by an accredited professional degree. </p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The accredited, first professional degree awarded by the College of Architecture is the <span class="basic-text-bold">master of architecture</span><span class="no-style-override"> </span>degree which is awarded at the successful conclusion of the professional program in architecture. This is the only accredited professional architecture program in the state of Nebraska.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>Upon successful completion of the one-year pre-architecture program, students who have been admitted to the second year may enroll in the curriculum that leads to the BSD degree and the MArch degree.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The professional program in architecture is structured to develop highly competent professional architects.</p>
			<p class="title-1" xml:lang='en-us'>Common First Year</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The Common First Year engages and prepares students for exciting futures in all design fields within the College of Architecture.</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The Common First Year curriculum offered by the College of Architecture, introduces students to design through courses in three areas: Technique (drawing and computer applications), Design Discipline (an introduction to the related design disciplines and design history), and Design Practice (design Thinking and design Making). In addition, students take University courses in math, English, communications, and a general education elective. dThink and dMake are sequential hands-on courses where students learn to work in teams to address problems and promote innovation. At the same time, they learn the foundational skills in composition, craft, presentation, and idea generation necessary for all design fields. </p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>At the end of the Common First Year, students have gained an understanding of the broad range of design and are eligible to apply to any of the design programs in the College—Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Interior Design, and Industrial Design (pending program approval).</p>
			<p class="content-box-h-1" xml:lang='en-us'>ADMISSION</p>
			<p class="title-1" xml:lang='en-us'>Admission to the Architecture Program</p>

			<p class="title-1" xml:lang='en-us'>Pre-Architecture Curriculum</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The pre-architecture curriculum begins with a basic design first year common to all undergraduate majors in the College of Architecture. This common first year introduces students to the fundamentals of design thinking and design making. The pre-architecture program is followed by three years of architectural instruction leading to a bachelor of science in design. After receipt of the bachelors degree, students may declare intentions to continue for an additional two years of study, leading to a professional master of architecture degree. The professional master of architecture degree is accredited by the National Architectural Accreditation Board (NAAB).</p>
			<p class="basic-text" xml:lang='en-us'>The College of Architecture, and all six years of the architecture program, are located in Lincoln. However, we do offer the option to do the first year of the program at UNO. After successfully completing the prescribed pre-architecture program at UNO, students may transfer to UNL and apply for admission to the second year of study in the Architecture Program.</p>
