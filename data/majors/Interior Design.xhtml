The four-year Interior Design Program consists of a two-year pre-interior design program and a subsequent two-year bachelor of science in design (BSD-Interior Design) major. After completing a two-year curriculum in pre-interior design, students apply for admission into the College of Architecture’s Interior Design Program. This Interior Design Program is fully accredited by the Council Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA). The Interior Design Program also offers a post-professional MS degree through the Graduate College. The graduate degree is also available through Distance Education.</p>				<p class="basic-text">This four-year, undergraduate program is for the student interested in becoming a professional interior designer. The professional interior designer is a person qualified by education, experience, and examination to 1) identify, research, and creatively explore issues related to the quality of the interior environment; 2) perform design services in interior spaces, including programming, design analysis, space planning and aesthetics, using specialized knowledge of interior construction, building systems and components, building codes, equipment materials and furnishings; and 3) prepare drawings and documents describing the design of interior spaces in order to enhance and protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.</p>				<p class="basic-text">Upon successful completion of two years of pre-interior design studies and admission to the Interior Design Program, students in the Interior Design Program may enroll in the curriculum which leads to a bachelor of science in design (BSD-Interior Design) degree.</p>				<p class="content-box-h-1">ADMISSION</p>				<p class="title-1">Admission to the 2-Year Bachelor of Science in Design Program—Interior Design</p>				<p class="title-2">Minimum Entrance Requirements</p>				<p class="basic-text">To be considered for admission to the Interior Design Program, applicants must:</p>				<p class="numbered-list">1.
