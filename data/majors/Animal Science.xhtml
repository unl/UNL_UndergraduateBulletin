This program is designed particularly for students who are interested in pursuing careers associated with the livestock, poultry, meat and companion animal industries. The core curriculum gives students a balanced education in animal science, biological sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, communications, and humanities and social sciences.</p>				<p class="basic-text">Each animal science student studies a core curriculum that provides a comprehensive look at animal biological systems, use of animal products, and current issues and careers in the animal industries. In addition to the core, there are seven different options from which students can choose an area of focus which meets their own individual interests and career objectives. These options include: Animal Biology; Animal Production and Management; Business; Companion Animal Science; Equine Sciences; Meat Science; and Veterinary Animal Sciences.</p>				<p class="basic-text">Students interested in any aspect of poultry science or avian biology may earn up to 24 credits through the Midwest Poultry Consortium’s Undergraduate Center of Excellence at Madison, WI. The credits may be applied toward an animal science degree from the University of Nebraska. Further details are available from the Animal Science Department.</p>				<p class="basic-text">Students pursuing a DVM degree at an accredited college of veterinary medicine may obtain a BS degree in animal science, granted by the University of Nebraska, upon satisfactory completion of the first two years of the curriculum in veterinary medicine. To be eligible, students must have completed at least 90 credit hours of pre-professional courses with 20 credit hours in animal science courses at the University of Nebraska. Further details are available from the Animal Science Department.</p>				<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>				<p class="title-1">Major Core Requirements</p>				<p class="basic-text">The following basic courses are required for majors in animal science.

Incoming freshman who have an interest in pursuing a career in the beef cattle or allied industries, regardless of major, are identified through an application process as candidates for the certificate program. Students must apply during the fall of their freshman year. Students in the program take a specialized series of courses including seminars with beef industry leaders, issues based courses, a comprehensive study tour, and a national policy course that includes a trip to the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association (NCBA) annual meeting and trade show. Students also help plan and conduct the annual Beef Summit that is held in the Animal Science Building every fall. In addition to the courses unique to NBIS, scholars will be required to take a commodities marketing class, a crisis communication course and two courses from the following: Cow/calf management, feedlot management, and fresh meats. In total, the program requires 18-20 credit hours. Currently, all scholars are student members of the Nebraska Cattleman’s Association. More information about the NBIS program can be found at http://www.animalscience.unl.edu/undergraduate/nbis.html or by contacting Dr. Matt Spangler. </p>			</div>		</div>	</body></html>
