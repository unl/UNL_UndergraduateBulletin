The program is designed to meet the agribusiness industry’s needs for professionals and entrepreneurs who have the educational background to become successful decision-makers in the rapidly changing agribusiness world. Agribusiness students interact with agribusiness professionals through learning and work-related opportunities, both in and out of the classroom. </p>				<p class="basic-text">Majoring in the agribusiness program prepares students for many agribusiness careers, such as:</p>				<p class="list-indent">Agribusiness Management</p>				<p class="list-indent">Finance and Lending</p>				<p class="list-indent">Real Estate Management and Investment</p>				<p class="list-indent">Commodity Trade and Analysis</p>				<p class="list-indent">Grain Merchandising</p>				<p class="list-indent">Market Planning and Analysis</p>				<p class="list-indent">International Marketing</p>				<p class="list-indent">Entrepreneurship and New Business Development</p>				<p class="list-indent">Sales Management</p>				<p class="list-indent">Information Technology and Analysis</p>				<p class="list-indent">Production Management</p>				<p class="list-indent">Food Marketing and Industry Organization</p>				<p class="basic-text">The agribusiness major also prepares students for graduate study in agribusiness, business administration, and agricultural economics.</p>				<p class="basic-text">The agribusiness major is a joint program between the College of Business Administration and the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources. It prepares students for careers in this dynamic and constantly changing field. It is the first program of this kind in the U.S. and is designed to meet the agribusiness industry’s need for employees with training in both business and agriculture.</p>				<p class="basic-text">Agribusiness majors take a blend of courses in business and agriculture that gives the student a balance between the decision-making framework of business and the technical aspects of modern agriculture and food systems. This means emphasis is placed on business and agriculture, making it an attractive degree for agribusiness employers and a very marketable degree for agribusiness students. The program also allows the student to build expertise in their area of interest by taking College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources courses in a specific area.</p>				<p class="content-box-h-1">ADMISSION</p>				<p class="title-1">Major/Department Admission</p>				<p class="basic-text">Admission requirements for all majors in the College are the same as those for University Admission as noted under UNL General Admission Requirements.</p>				<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>				<p class="title-1">Core Requirements</p>				<ul>					<li class="bullet-1">As noted in the College Degree Requirements section, all course work for the major must be taken for a grade.</li>					<li class="bullet-1">Agribusiness majors may elect to fulfill the Business Core Intermediate (BCI) requirement of MNGT 350/MIST 350 with MRKT 350.</li>					<li class="bullet-1">Students interested in agronomy or chemical sales are recommended to take CHEM 109.</li>					<li class="bullet-1">Agribusiness majors through the College of Business Administration may <span class="basic-text-bold">not</span> count AECN 141 Introduction to the Economics of Agriculture toward the degree unless transferring in from another college.</li>					<li class="bullet-1">Double counting options: There are several agriculture courses offered through the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources that may be used to fulfill both requirements for Non-Business Requirements (NBR) for the College as well as for the agribusiness major:</li>					<li class="bullet-2">NBR 3 (ACE 4) – AGRI 115, AGRO 131, ENTO 115, MSYM 109, NRES 108, PLPT 110 may be taken to fulfill the science requirement (NBR 3–ACE 4) as well as a requirement for the major. </li>					<li class="bullet-2">NBR 6 (ACE 9) – AECN 346, AECN 367, AECN 420, AECN 425, AGRI 282, ENSC 110, HORT 200, may be taken to fulfill the global awareness requirement (NBR 6–ACE 9) as well as a requirement for the major. </li>					<li class="bullet-2">In instances where double counting occurs, course work selected for the first major that is also double counted for NBR may not, in turn, also be used to satisfy the College <span class="basic-text-bold">electives</span> of 300/400-level requirement nor may NBR course work double counting for the major be double counted for any minor in which these courses could be used to fulfill minor requirements.
