It resembles the construction management program but provides a greater emphasis on engineering, scientific, and technical courses so that requirements for licensure are met. </p>				<p class="basic-text">Construction engineers prepare engineering and architectural plans and specifications which they translate into finished projects, such as buildings, bridges, highways, power plants, or other constructed facilities. These projects involve details shared by a team of owners, architects, engineers, general constructors, specialty constructors, manufacturers, material suppliers, equipment distributors, regulatory bodies, labor resources, and numerous others. The constructor assumes responsibility for delivery of the completed project at a specified time and cost and also accepts associated legal, financial, and management obligations.</p>				<p class="basic-text">The construction industry has expanded its technological capabilities in physical and informational systems, and the demand gives graduates numerous opportunities for employment and pursuing an advanced degree.</p>				<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>				<p class="basic-text">Students are required to enroll in a predetermined set of courses specifically designed for general construction education. Each student selects, with the approval of his/her adviser, a set of approved electives. Students may take their first four semesters of courses in Lincoln but the last four semesters must be completed at Omaha.</p>				<p class="requirement-hours">First Semester Hours</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">CHEM 109 General Chemistry I 4</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">CONE 103 Intro to Construction Engineering 1</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">CSCE 150E Intro to Computer Programming for Scientists &amp; Engineers 3</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">JGEN 200 Technical Communication I 3</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">MATH 106 Analytic Geometry &amp; Calculus I 5</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2"><span class="requirement-bold">Total 16</span></p>				<p class="requirement-hours">Second Semester Hours</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">MATH 107 Analytic Geometry &amp; Calculus II 5</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">MECH 130 Intro to CAD 2</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">PHYS 211 General Physics I 4</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">PHYS 221 General Physics Lab 1</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">ACE Elective 3</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-3-note">Choose one course each from ACE outcomes 5, 7, 8, and 9 elective courses.</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2"><span class="requirement-bold">Total 15</span></p>				<p class="requirement-hours">Third Semester Hours</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">CIVE 221 Geometric Control Systems 3</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">COMM 286 Business &amp; Professional Communication 3</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">ENGM 223 Engineering Statics 3</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">MATH 208 Analytic Geometry &amp; Calculus III 4</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">PHYS 212 General Physics II 4</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2"><span class="requirement-bold">Total 17</span></p>				<p class="requirement-hours">Fourth Semester Hours</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">ENGM 325 Mechanics of Elastic Bodies 3</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">ENGM 373 Engineering Dynamics 3</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">IMSE 206 Engineering Economics I 3</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">MATH 221 Differential Equations 3</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2">ACE Elective 3</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-3-note">Choose one course each from ACE outcomes 5, 7, 8, and 9 elective courses.</p>				<p class="requirement-sec-2"><span class="requirement-bold">Total 15</span></p>				<p class="title-3">Fifth through eighth semesters are taken in Omaha.</p>				<p class="content-box-h-1">ADDITIONAL MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>				<p class="title-1">Grade Rules </p>				<p class="basic-text">All coursework must be of “C” grade level or higher to be credited toward graduation requirements or to be valid as a prerequisite for another course.</p>				<p class="end">###</p>			</div>		</div>	</body></html>
