The distinct feature of this career path is that it provides students with knowledge and intervention skills that will assist them in helping to prevent and remedy interpersonal problems experienced by individuals in their family relationships, building on the family’s strengths. In addition, this career path will prepare students for graduate school (e.g. family science, family therapy, social work, counseling psychology, and law), or for employment in human services agencies or programs. Students are prepared to work in human service agencies or nonprofit agencies serving individuals and families. Students selecting several courses in the economic and family finance content area are prepared to advise in the areas of consumer credit and financial management. These courses may make them eligible to take the Accredited Financial Counselors examinations.</p>				<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>				<p class="list">CEHS 200 Families, Schools &amp; Communities (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="list">CYAF 160 Human Development &amp; the Family (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="list">CYAF 222 Intro to Family Finance (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="list">CYAF 280 Family Science (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="list">CYAF 380 Working with Families in Communities &amp; Schools (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="list">CYAF 285 Dating &amp; Couple Relationships <span class="faculty-list-bold">or</span> CYAF 382 Parenting (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="list">CYAF 488 Child &amp; Family Policy (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="list">CYAF 495 Special Topics in Family &amp; Cultural Diversity <span class="faculty-list-bold">or</span> ETHN XXX (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="list">CYAF 497D Community Internship in Family &amp; Consumer Sciences (3 hrs)</p>				<p class="list">Human Development <span class="list-ital">(select one)</span>: </p>				<p class="list-indent">CYAF 270/CYAF 270L, CYAF 271/CYAF 271L, CYAF 372, CYAF 462; GERO 200, GERO 307, GERO 446, GERO 447; EDPS 250, EDPS 251, EDPS 450, EDPS 451; PSYC 446, PSYC 489</p>				<p class="title-3">Supporting Courses:</p>				<p class="list">LIBR 110</p>				<p class="list">ALEC 102, COMM 109, COMM 209, COMM 210, or COMM 286</p>				<p class="list">ECON 215, EDPS 459, MATH 104, MATH 106, MATH 107, MATH 108H, MATH 203, MATH 208, STAT 218</p>				<p class="list">Science Course with Lab: </p>				<p class="list-indent">ANTH 242 &amp; ANTH 242L; BIOS 101 &amp; BIOS 101L, BIOS 103; CHEM 105, CHEM 109, CHEM 110, CHEM 113; ENTO 115 &amp; ENTO 116; GEOG 155; GEOL 101, GEOL 103; METR 200; NRES 108; PHYS 141, PHYS 142, PHYS 151 &amp; PHYS 153, PHYS 211 &amp; PHYS 221, PHYS 212 &amp; PHYS 222; PHYS 260 &amp; PHYS 262; or TXCD 206</p>				<p class="title-1">Tracks/Options/Concentrations/Emphases Requirements</p>				<p class="basic-text">Students must select either an Option A or Option B career path.
