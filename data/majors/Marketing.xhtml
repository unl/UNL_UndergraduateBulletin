The management of activities related to the flow of both goods and services from producer to consumer has become increasingly important in this age of consumer-oriented production. This importance has increased the demand for well-qualified persons, both as specialists in technical aspects of marketing and as general marketing managers. New developments are appearing in quantitative analysis of marketing problems, in studies of consumer behavior, in international marketing, and in the social responsibilities of marketing. These developments hold exciting promise for the future.</p>				<p class="basic-text">Academic preparation for some careers is best achieved by combining marketing courses with courses in other departments of the University. For this reason it is important for the student to consult with a faculty member in the Department of Marketing before deciding on a particular course of study. Courses within the department include those from the following disciplines: Marketing, Marketing Communication, Distribution Channels, Retailing, Sales Management, Marketing Research, Professional Selling, Sports Marketing, Consumer Behavior, and International Marketing. Outside the College, courses in psychology, sociology, journalism, mathematics, communication studies, art, and geography may be helpful.</p>				<p class="content-box-h-1">ADMISSION</p>				<p class="title-1">Major/Department Admission</p>				<p class="basic-text">Admission requirements for all majors in the College are the same as those for University Admission as noted under UNL General Admission Requirements.</p>				<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>				<p class="title-1">Core Requirements</p>				<p class="basic-text">All students, regardless of their major or interests in the College will take MRKT 341 Marketing as part of the Business Core Intermediate requirements.</p>				<ul>					<li class="bullet-1">In addition to the College Degree Requirements, students will complete 18 hours of course work for the major.</li>					<li class="bullet-1">As noted in the College Degree Requirements section, all course work for the major must be taken for a grade.</li>					<li class="bullet-1">MRKT 399/ MRKT 499 may not count toward the major or minor in marketing.</li>					<li class="bullet-1">Due to the major consisting of only 18 hours of marketing course work, marketing majors will take an additional business elective as part of their business elective requirement.
