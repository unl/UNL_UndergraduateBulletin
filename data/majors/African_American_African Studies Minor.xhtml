The minor will contribute to the students’ understanding of the diverse peoples and cultures of Africa, their awareness of the relativity of cultures, and, ultimately, to a better understanding of their own society. The minor, which is interdisciplinary, will appeal not only to students in the humanities, social sciences, and education, but also to students who plan to do international work.</p>				<p class="basic-text">The minor in African American Studies is designed to expose students to a program of study concerning African American culture, life, and history in the United States as well as the African experience on the continent and/or in the Diaspora.</p>				<p class="content-box-h-1">REQUIREMENTS FOR MINOR OFFERED BY DEPARTMENT</p>				<p class="title-1">Requirements for the Minor in African Studies</p>				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Plan A.</span> At least 18 hours (from at least two departments) from among the courses listed below, including independent study and special topics approved by the minor adviser.</p>				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Plan B.</span> At least 12 hours (from at least two departments) from the courses listed below, and any University Studies courses offered with an African emphasis, including independent study and special topics approved by the minor adviser.</p>				<p class="list">ANTH 362 Peoples &amp; Cultures of Africa (ETHN 362) (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 150 African Culture &amp; Civilization (HIST 150) (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 244A Intro to African Literature (ENGL 244A) (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 244B Black Women Authors (ENGL 244B/WMNS 244B) (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 244D African-Caribbean Literature (ENGL 244D) (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 485 Africa Since 1800 (HIST 485/885) (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 486 History of South Africa (HIST 486) (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">POLS 260 Problems in International Relations (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">POLS 474/874 Comparative Institutions (3 cr)</p>				<p class="title-1">Requirements for the Minor in African American Studies</p>				<p class="title-3">Core Course</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 200 Intro to African American Studies (3 cr)</p>				<p class="header-paragraph">At least 15 hours (from at least three departments) from the following courses (other courses may be used with the approval of the minor adviser):</p>				<p class="list">ANTH 362 Peoples &amp; Cultures of Africa (ETHN 362) (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 150 African Culture &amp; Civilization (HIST 150) (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 212 Intro to Cultural Anthropology (ANTH 212) (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 217 Nationality &amp; Race Relations (SOCI 217) (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 238 Blacks &amp; the American Political System (POLS 238) (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 244 African-American Literature (ENGL 244) (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 244B Black Women Authors (ENGL 244B/WMNS 244B) (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 244E Early African-American Literature (ENGL 244E) (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 306 African American History: African Origins to 1877 (HIST 306) (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 330 Multicultural Education (TEAC 330) (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 440 The Black Family (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 446 Black Social Movements (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 481 Minority Groups (SOCI 481) (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">ETHN 485 Africa Since 1800 (HIST 485) (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">HIST 486 History of South Africa (3 cr)</p>				<p class="list">MUNM 387 History of American Jazz (3 cr)</p>				<p class="end">###</p>			</div>		</div>	</body></html>
