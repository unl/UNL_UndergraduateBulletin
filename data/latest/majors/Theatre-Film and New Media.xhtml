				<p class="basic-text">The film and new media emphasis (FNM) is for those desiring concentrated training/education in film and new media technology, screen writing, new media design, digital media content, film special effects, film producing and directing. Digital video, 16mm motion pictures and computer-generated animation are all areas the film and new media student may explore. Whatever the area of interest, a key foundation of the film and new media program is to provide comprehensive training while requiring students to put their education into practice.</p>

				<p class="basic-text">Students must apply for admission to the BFA emphasis in Film and New Media (FNM) by completing an application form and supplying references, a resume and examples of creative work. This application applies to both new students and transfer students. Students who are applying for transfer into the program must complete the application and provide grade transcripts demonstrating a 3.0 current and cumulative GPA or higher. Students should contact the Johnny Carson School of Theatre and Film for information and application materials.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Once the application materials have been received, the student will be notified by the school if accepted to the FNM emphasis. Once accepted, a student must maintain a 3.0 current and cumulative GPA from that point forward, complete a portfolio review (after taking THEA 482), and receive approval from the FNM faculty before they may granted full FNM student status. The Johnny Carson School of Theatre and Film reserves the right to limit the total number of FNM students accepted and FNM students allowed to continue in the emphasis.</p>
