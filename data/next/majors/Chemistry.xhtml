<p class="basic-text">Chemistry deals with the analysis, structure, properties, and synthesis of matter ranging in size from single atoms to biologically-active small molecules to DNA and proteins. A degree in chemistry prepares students for many career options: industry (research, analysis, production), teaching, graduate studies, or professional schools. Chemistry is also a valuable second major for students completing degrees in a number of science, math, or engineering disciplines. The bachelor of science (BS) is recommended for students planning graduate studies or professional careers in chemistry and is also an excellent choice for pre-medicine. The bachelor of arts (BA) program is designed for students needing undergraduate training in chemistry as preparation for professional careers outside of chemistry and fits easily into pre-medical, pre-pharmacy, pre-health, and pre-law degree programs. A degree with a chemistry emphasis is available to students enrolled in the Environmental Studies program (consult that entry for details). The chemistry department hosts a Web page with other information (scholarships, etc.) relating to the undergraduate programs at http://chem.unl.edu/undergrad/.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Laboratory Fee and Deposit.</span> Students who enroll in chemistry laboratory courses pay a special fee to defray the cost of materials and equipment. The special fee is applied to tuition in the amounts given in the Office of the University Registrar's website at registrar.unl.edu.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Breakage Costs.</span> Glassware and equipment that are lost or damaged by the student are charged to the students N-card for 200-level, 300-level, and 400-level classes.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Work.</span> The advanced degrees of master of science and doctor of philosophy are offered. For details, consult the <span class="basic-text-ital">Graduate Studies Bulletin</span>.</p>
