<p class="basic-text">Students must apply for admission to the BFA emphasis in Film and New Media (FNM) by completing an application, which includes references, a resume, and examples of creative work. This application applies to both new students and transfer students. Those who are applying for transfer into the program must complete the application and provide grade transcripts demonstrating a 3.0 current and cumulative GPA or higher. Students should visit the Johnny Carson School of Theatre and Film website for information and application procedures.</p>
<p class="basic-text">After the application materials have been reviewed by the faculty, students will be notified of their acceptance status. Once admitted, a student must maintain a 3.0 cumulative GPA from that point forward and complete a portfolio review during the sophomore year. Admission to the FNM emphasis is highly competitive; the Johnny Carson School of Theatre and Film reserves the right to limit the total number of FNM students accepted to the program.</p>
