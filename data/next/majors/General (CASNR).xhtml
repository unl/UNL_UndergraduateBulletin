<p class="faculty-list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">Coordinator: Tiffany Heng-Moss</span>, 103 Agricultural Hall</p>
<p class="basic-text">Many students are unsure of which degree program to choose when entering the university. In fact, over half of all students entering UNL change their degree program at least once. The following program is available for students not yet ready to make the decision.</p>
<p class="title-1">Exploratory Studies</p>
<p class="basic-text">The courses listed below compose a non-degree program entitled Exploratory Studies. The program is designed for students who are interested in a bachelor of science degree in the applied life sciences, agricultural sciences, natural resource sciences, or social sciences offered in the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, but are uncertain about a specific degree program. Such students will receive individualized advising and mentoring from a faculty member and be encouraged to participate in clubs and other pre-professional activities to help them decide which career path is right for them.</p>
<p class="basic-text">This list of suggested courses for the first semester should provide the student maximum flexibility while ensuring that courses contribute to any of the degree programs within the College as well as most programs in other colleges. During the first semester, students should contact Associate Dean Tiffany Heng-Moss to identify an appropriate advisor(s) in a degree program(s) of their area of interest to plan appropriate courses for subsequent semesters. Students may be in the program for two years (60 credit hours). Students may declare a degree program at any time, but must declare a degree program at the completion of 60 hours.</p>
