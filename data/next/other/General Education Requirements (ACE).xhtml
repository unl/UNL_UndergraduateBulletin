<p class="faculty-list">http://ace.unl.edu</p>
<p class="basic-text">Consistent with the mission and values of the University, Achievement-Centered Education (ACE) is based on a shared set of four institutional objectives and 10 student learning outcomes. The ACE program was approved by faculty in all eight undergraduate colleges and endorsed by the Faculty Senate, the student government, and the Academic Planning Committee in January 2008 and implemented in the fall 2009. Key characteristics of ACE demonstrate the benefits of the program to students:</p>
<ul>
<li class="bullet-1">Students receive a broad education with exposure to multiple disciplines, critical life skills and important reasoning, inquiry, and civic capacities.</li>
<li class="bullet-1">ACE is simple and transparent for students, faculty and advisors. Students complete the equivalent of 3 credit hours for each of the ten student learning outcomes.</li>
<li class="bullet-1">Students connect and integrate their ACE experiences with their selected major.</li>
<li class="bullet-1">Students can transfer all ACE certified courses across colleges within the institution to meet the ACE requirement and any course from outside the institution that is directly equivalent to a UNL ACE-certified course. Courses from outside institutions without direct equivalents may be considered with appropriate documentation for ACE credit (see academic advisor).</li>
<li class="bullet-1">ACE allows faculty to assess and improve their effectiveness and facilitate students’ learning.</li>
</ul>
<p class="content-box-h-1">ACE INSTITUTIONAL OBJECTIVES AND STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES</p>

<p class="basic-text">Build knowledge of diverse peoples and cultures and of the natural and physical world through the study of mathematics, sciences and technologies, histories, humanities, arts, social sciences, and human diversity.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">ACE 4:</span> Use scientific methods and knowledge of the natural and physical world to address problems through inquiry, interpretation, analysis, and the making of inferences from data, to determine whether conclusions or solutions are reasonable.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">ACE 5: </span>Use knowledge, historical perspectives, analysis, interpretation, critical evaluation, and the standards of evidence appropriate to the humanities to address problems and issues.</p>
