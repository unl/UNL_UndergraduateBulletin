<p class="title-1">Academic Advising</p>
<p class="faculty-list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">Undergraduate Advising:</span> Tiffany Heng-Moss</p>
<p class="basic-text">Advising activities are coordinated by the Associate Dean for Student Affairs in the CASNR Dean’s Office. Each student in the College is assigned a faculty or professional advisor to assist in career planning, implementing, and completing academic programs. Assignments are made so that students will be working with an advisor who shares their academic interest. Students are encouraged to visit with their faculty or professional advisor about their career interests and development opportunities. Students may change their college, degree, and/or advisor. Such changes must be initiated in 103 Agricultural Hall.</p>
<p class="title-1">Student Responsibility</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are ultimately responsible for fulfilling all the requirements of the curriculum in which they are enrolled. Students are also responsible for initiating advising contacts and preparing for advising sessions. The mentoring relationship between academic advisors and students is confidential and is strengthened by advisors’ listening with empathy.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are expected to take responsibility for successful university experiences and effective advising sessions by:</p>
<p class="list">1. Participating in New Student Enrollment and priority registration programs;</p>
<p class="list">2. Scheduling appointments with advisors well in advance of priority registration and at other times as needed;</p>
<p class="list">3. Identifying class choices from requirements of the selected program;</p>
<p class="list">4. Identifying questions to address in advising sessions;</p>
<p class="list">5. Informing advisors of any special needs, deficiencies or barriers that might affect academic success;</p>

<p class="title-1">Credit by Examination</p>
<p class="basic-text">Through study or experience that parallels a University of Nebraska–Lincoln course, a regularly enrolled University student may feel prepared to pass an examination on the course content of a specific course for credit in that course. To apply for credit, a student should:</p>
<p class="list">1. Consult with the department head or designee.</p>
<p class="list">2. Obtain a Credit by Examination Form at the Records Office, 107 Canfield Administration Building, 402-472-3649. Current enrollment in the University must also be verified.</p>
<p class="list">3. Secure the approval signature from the department head, instructor, and the dean of the college. The Dean’s signature can be obtained in the 103 Agricultural Hall.</p>
<p class="list">4. Secure the bursar’s receipt for payment of the appropriate fee per course for credit by examination. Currently, the fee is one-half the resident tuition rate.</p>
<p class="list">5. Present the completed form to the instructor designated by the department head. The instructor will give the examination and report the results on the Credit by Examination Form to the Admissions Office, Alexander Building, 402-472-0130.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Examination for credit through UNL departments may be taken only by currently enrolled students. A student is not permitted to receive credit by examination in a course which is a prerequisite for a course already taken unless the course and its prerequisites cover essentially different subject matter.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The College also gives credit for the subject and general examinations of the College Level Examination Program (CLEP) and the Advanced Placement (AP) Program administered by the College Entrance Examination Board. See the CASNR Associate Dean, 103 Agricultural Hall, for current policy regarding CLEP and AP examinations.</p>
<p class="title-1">Dual Degrees</p>
<p class="title-2">Dual Degrees from the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students in CASNR may earn a bachelor of science degree in more than one program. They must complete all requirements for both programs.</p>
<p class="title-2">Dual Degrees from CASNR and Other UNL Colleges</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students in other colleges may earn a bachelor of science from CASNR and a degree from another UNL college. Students will need to consult with both colleges to ensure all requirements are satisfied.</p>
<p class="title-2">Grading Appeals</p>
<p class="basic-text">A student who feels that he/she has been unfairly graded must ordinarily take the following sequential steps in a timely manner, usually by initiating the appeal in the semester following the awarding of the grade:</p>
<p class="list">1. Talk with the instructor concerned. Most problems are resolved at this point.</p>
<p class="list">2. Talk to the instructor’s department head.</p>
<p class="list">3. Take the case to the Grading Appeal Committee of the department concerned. The Committee should be contacted through the department head.</p>
<p class="list">4. Take the case to the CASNR Curriculum Committee by contacting the Dean’s Office, 103 Agricultural Hall. Notification to the Curriculum Committee must be in writing and will include in the notice a statement of the grounds of appeal. Both the student and the instructor will be given an opportunity to present materials to the committee in the presence of each other.</p>
<p class="title-1">Graduation Application</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are expected to develop a clear understanding of degree requirements and to plan their course of study with a College advisor. Students requiring clarification of outstanding degree requirements should visit with a College advisor promptly.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students should access their Degree Audit via MyRed at least once each term to review degree requirements and progress toward graduation. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure their Degree Audit accurately reflects their current College and program of study.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students who believe their Degree Audit has errors or omissions should visit with a College advisor promptly. It is important that you resolve these matters as soon as practicable to avoid a delay in graduation.</p>
<p>Each student with MyRED access must submit an online Application for Graduation via MyRED for each degree to be received by:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last Friday in January for May graduation</li>
<li>The last Friday in June for August graduation</li>
<li>The last Friday in September for December graduation</li>
</ul>
<p class="basic-text">Students submitting an electronic Application for Graduation via MyRed will be billed a $25.00 per degree fee on their student account. Those students without MyRED access may apply for graduation in person at the Office of the University Registrar, 107 Canfield Administration Building or by mail. Applications for Graduation submitted in person or by mail must be accompanied by a check or money order in the amount of $25.00 payable to the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Failure to submit a timely Application for Graduation may preclude the awarding of a degree in the intended term.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Your Application for Graduation and required $25.00 fee are good only for the term marked on your application. Neither your application nor your fee, are transferrable to another term. If you submit an Application for Graduation and pay the $25.00 fee for a specified term but do not complete your degree requirements in that term, you will need to reapply to graduate in a future term and incur another $25.00 fee.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Commencement ceremony information will be emailed to all degree applicants approximately one month before graduation. Each student who has applied for graduation must submit an online Commencement Attendance Form via MyRED, which will be available when the informational email is distributed.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Only those students who have applied for graduation, had the application accepted, and fulfilled all degree requirements as of the last day of the academic term may participate in the commencement ceremony for that term. Because the University of Nebraska–Lincoln has a commencement for each term, ceremony participation is allowed only in the term during which the student has properly and timely applied for graduation and fulfilled degree requirements.</p>
<p class="title-1">Honors Program</p>
<p class="basic-text">The College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources encourages qualified students to participate in the University Honors Program which is a UNL-wide program. The College’s honors students pursue degree programs offered by the College while completing the required honors courses.</p>
<p class="basic-text">All University Honors Program students are expected to complete a mentored thesis project with a faculty member of their choosing. Students should enroll in AGRI 299H in the spring semester of their sophomore year. As a part of AGRI 299H, students will identify a faculty thesis mentor and write a thesis proposal with their faculty thesis mentor. Because of the breadth of degrees, the program relies on faculty mentors within individual degree programs to determine the criteria for an undergraduate thesis in their area of endeavor. General guidance for mentors is provided as requested by Dr. Madhavan Soundararajan.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The Agricultural Research Division supports a competitive grants program to assist the College’s Honors Program students in the pursuit of their mentored theses. Students may also seek support from UNL’s Undergraduate Creative Activities and Research Experience (UCARE) program.</p>

<p class="title-3">Filing for a Minor</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students wishing to declare a minor, must file a new C-D-M-A (College-Degree-Major-Advisor) form with the Dean’s Office prior to filing for graduation if the minor is exactly the same as that published in the student’s Undergraduate Bulletin. If there are any variations from the published minor, then the student must file the “Revision of Minor” form with the Dean’s Office.</p>
<p class="title-3">Minors in Other Colleges</p>
<p class="basic-text">A student with a degree leading to a bachelor of science degree who wants to obtain a minor in a department in the College of Arts and Sciences should use the following procedure in making his/her request:</p>
<p class="list">1. In consultation with the advisor, prepare the list of courses required for either Plan A or Plan B in the chosen minor as indicated in the College of Arts and Sciences section of this bulletin. Plan A indicates a single minor; Plan B indicates two minors with fewer hours in each subject than the number required for a single minor.</p>
<p class="list">2. Submit the C-D-M-A form for the minor to the CASNR Dean’s Office prior to the deadline for submitting the application for graduation.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph">Students who have questions related to the minor after it is declared should consult an advisor in the college through which it is offered. The minor will be recorded on the student’s transcript.</p>
