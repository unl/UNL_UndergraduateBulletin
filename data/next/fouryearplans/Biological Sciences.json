In addition, biological sciences majors are strongly encouraged to be involved in research. See your adviser for more details.\r\n\r\nTHIS IS A SAMPLE PLAN ONLY \u2013 Please see an Academic Advisor at least once a semester to plan courses that best fit your individual circumstances and goals.\r\n\r\nBACHELOR OF ARTS (BA) vs. BACHELOR OF SCIENCE (BS) DEGREES:  Both the BA and BS require students to complete the University ACE requirements, the College of Arts and Sciences distribution requirements, the requirements for a major, the requirements for a minor or minors if required by the major, and the College of Arts and Sciences graduation requirements.  \r\n\u2022\tThe BS contains, in addition, an essential scientific base of at least 60 hours within the natural and mathematical sciences.  \r\n\u2022\tThe specific major requirements within a BS are the same as those for the BA, with the following exceptions:  Chemistry, Environmental Studies (ancillary requirements), Geology, Mathematics and Physics.  \r\n\u2022\tThe following majors are only available within the BS degree: Biochemistry, Meteorology\/Climatology and Microbiology.\r\n\r\nUPPER LEVEL REQUIREMENT: At least 30 hours of courses numbered 300 or above are required. Of those 30 hours, at least 15 must be completed at UNL.\r\n"}}}
