Raikes School of Computer Science and Management may substitute RAIK 381H or RAIK 382H for CSCE 488, and RAIK 302H or RAIK 402H for CSCE 489 with advance approval from both the Design Studio and Computer Engineering Senior Design instructors.\r\n\r\nComputer engineering majors may take CSCE 155A, CSCE 155H, CSCE 155N, or CSCE 155T instead of CSCE 155E.\r\n\r\nTaking CSCE 488 satisfies ACE outcome 8.\r\n\r\nDouble majors in electrical engineering may elect to take either of the senior design course sequences (CSCE 488 then CSCE 489 or ELEC 494 then ELEC 495). Students not taking CSCE 488 must satisfy ACE outcome 8 with another course(s).\r\n"}}}
