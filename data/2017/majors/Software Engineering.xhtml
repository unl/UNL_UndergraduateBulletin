<p class="basic-text">The UNL Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) offers Nebraska's only comprehensive program of higher education, research, and service outreach in computer science, computer engineering, and software engineering.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The CSE department offers a unique and challenging baccalaureate degree program in software engineering, incorporating hands-on learning and an integrated computer science and software engineering core curriculum to prepare graduates for professional practice in a wide range of industries and for post-graduate education.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Software engineers work on multidisciplinary teams to identify and formulate software solutions and maintain software intensive systems of all sizes. The focus of this program is on the rigorous engineering practices necessary to build, maintain and protect modern software intensive systems. Consistent with this focus, the software engineering baccalaureate program consists of a rigorous curriculum of science, math, computer science, and software engineering courses. Students completing the major will have the ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply disciplined software engineering practices and principles to the design, architecture, development, analysis, testing and maintenance of complex software systems to meet the desired needs of the stakeholders and within realistic constraints.</li>
<li>Identify, formulate and solve engineering problems using computational resources.</li>
<li>Contribute their expertise to the solution of problems by effectively collaborating and communicating with other stakeholders in multidisciplinary teams.</li>
<li>Adapt to rapid advances in computing and software engineering tools, technologies, principles and practices.</li>
</ul>
<p class="header-paragraph">Students will also have:</p>
<ul>
<li>The background and perspective for post-graduate education. Studies develop skills in the application of theory, experimentation, and life-long learning/professional development.</li>
<li>Insight into the world of practicing professionals for collaborations, mutual support, and representing the profession to government and society. Studies include teamwork, communication, and hands-on experience, plus students are provided with multiple opportunities for involvement in organizations such as ACM, UPE, and IEEE.</li>
</ul>
<p class="basic-text">The CSE department also offers a degree of bachelor of science in computer engineering through the College of Engineering, and a bachelor of science in computer science through the College of Arts and Sciences. All students majoring in the CSE department should see their advisors during the first semester to ensure they understand the differences in the requirements between the three majors. Majors should consult with their advisors each semester for registration advising.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Introductory Courses.</span> Entering students take SOFT 160 Software Engineering I, the first course in the software engineering core series (SOFT 160, SOFT 161, SOFT 260, SOFT 261). This course provides an introduction to fundamental software engineering concepts and foundational computer science topics to prepare students for more advanced software engineering and computer science courses.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Programs.</span> The CSE Department offers several graduate degree programs: master of science in computer science, master of science in computer science with a computer engineering specialization, master of science in computer science with a bioinformatics specialization, doctor of philosophy in computer science, doctor of philosophy in engineering with computer engineering specialization, doctor of philosophy in computer science with bioinformatics specialization, and joint doctor of philosophy in computer science and mathematics. See the <em>Graduate Studies Bulletin</em> for details.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR DEPARTMENT ADMISSION</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are expected to meet minimum college entrance requirements. After being admitted to the college, students desiring to pursue a degree in software engineering must go through the Professional Admission process, which is automatically performed for qualifying students at the end of the sophomore year.
