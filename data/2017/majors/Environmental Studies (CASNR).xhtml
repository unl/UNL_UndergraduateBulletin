<p class="faculty-list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">Website:</span> http://esp.unl.edu/</p>
<p class="basic-text">The environmental studies major is designed for students who want to make a difference and contribute to solving environmental challenges on a local to global scale. Solutions to challenges as climate change, pollution, and resource conservation require individuals who have a broad-based knowledge in the natural and social sciences, as well as strength in a specific discipline. The environmental studies major will provide the knowledge and skills needed for students to work across disciplines and to be competitive in the job market. The environmental studies program uses a holistic approach and a framework of sustainability. This framework recognizes the necessity of meeting current resource needs without compromising the environment or the ability of future generations to meet their needs.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The degree program consists of four required components:</p>
<p class="numbered-list">1. Environmental studies core courses introduce students to the major (ENVR 101) and provide a foundation in the scientific and human dimensions of environmental challenges (ENVR 201 and ENVR 249). Students will have the opportunity to work with individuals and organizations involved in environmental challenges within the community (ENVR 319). The required internship course (ENVR 495) provides the opportunity to gain work experience related to academic and career objectives. The "capstone" senior thesis series (ENVR 499A and ENVR 499B) provides an opportunity to complete a scholarly creative or research product.</p>
<p class="numbered-list">2. General collateral courses in Earth and Environmental Systems, Human Dimensions, and Economics and Policy: Earth and environmental systems courses provide the opportunity to explore Earth's four major spheres (land, water, living things, air) and the influence humans have had on their variability over space and through time. Human dimensions courses allow an exploration of human factors driving environmental change: law, politics, ethics, human behavior, cultural diversity, decision-making, and communication. Economics and Policy courses provide an additional lens to view environmental challenges. In addition, students will use and apply relevant research methods, tolls, and technologies to address environmental challenges in an ethical manner.</p>
<p class="numbered-list">3. Ancillary requirements in natural sciences (biology, chemistry and physics), mathematics, and statistics.</p>
<p class="numbered-list">4. Emphasis area courses. To provide depth within a particular discipline, completion of an emphasis area is required. Three options are available to the students—Natural Resources, Public Health, or completion of a CASNR minor. Students are also encouraged to complete an additional 6 credit hours of discipline specific course work at the 300 level or higher.</p>

<p class="title-2">Program Emphasis Areas</p>
<p class="requirement-sec-1">Select one of the following three options:</p>
<p class="title-3">Option 1. Any CASNR Minor or second major, selected in consultation with academic advisor – 18 cr</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are strongly encouraged to add 6 additional credits at the 300 level or higher of discipline-specific courses, especially if they are considering graduate work.</p>
<p class="title-3">Option 2. Natural Resources – 19-25 cr</p>
<p class="basic-text">The Natural Resources emphasis area has been designed to allow a student to tailor their course work to meet their learning and career objectives. By the end of their sophomore year, the student will work with the environmental studies academic advising team to develop an individual study plan for approval. Their plan of study must include at least 7 courses and a minimum of 19 hours of course work in natural resources courses (NRES, WATS, SOIL, RNGE). Three of the courses need to be at the 300 level or above. A rationale for the courses they have chosen as they relate to learning or career objectives will be submitted with their study plan. The plan can be changed at any time, but must receive appropriate approval.</p>
<p class="title-3">Option 3. Public Health – 18 cr</p>
<p class="basic-text">The public health emphasis is a collaborative program between the bachelor of science in environmental studies (BSES) at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln (UNL) and the master of public health (MPH) with a concentration in environmental and occupational health (EOH) at the University of Nebraska Medical Center (UNMC) (http://www.unmc.edu/publichealth/programs/mphdualdegree/bses-mph.html). The program provides students in the environmental studies program at UNL an option to complete the undergraduate degree in environmental studies and the MPH in EOH in about five years. The collaborative program is designed for dedicated undergraduate students who are motivated and willing to take on the challenges and opportunities related to professional education. The collaborative BSES and MPH in EOH involves intensive study, a senior thesis, service learning, and capstone courses in EOH.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The collaborative program is a 147-155 credit hour undergraduate/professional option allowing eligible students to work toward the EOH concentration in the MPH program requirements while completing their undergraduate degree. Students interested in this option will work closely with their advisors to develop an integrated plan of study. The plan will cover the entire undergraduate and professional program and will be reviewed each semester with the student’s advisors. A maximum of 18 credits from the MPH program (of the required 45 graduate credits for the MPH degree) will be counted toward the undergraduate degree. The student will receive a BS in environmental studies with an emphasis in public health and an MPH with a concentration in environmental and occupational health. Students with sophomore standing and at least 45 hours of completed course work in their undergraduate degree program may apply for admission to the collaborative BSES and MPH in EOH. See the environmental studies program coordinator or the UNMC graduate studies bulletin for pre-requisite and admission process details.</p>

<p class="title-1">Environmental Education Minor</p>
<p class="basic-text">A minor in environmental education is designed to provide additional qualifications for students interested in pursuing a career in the field of environmental and natural resources education. Career options for students pursuing an environmental education minor include working in formal and non-formal educational settings; employment in the public or private sector; and serving as educational specialists, extension educators, and program leaders. Courses selected for the minor’s curriculum were chosen for their holistic perspective and interdisciplinary approach to environmental and natural resources studies. A number of the courses focus regionally on the environment of the Great Plains.</p>

<p class="title-1">Society and the Environment Minor</p>
<p class="basic-text">The society and the environment minor will prepare students to contribute solutions for current and future local, regional, and global environmental challenges. Stewardship and the efficient, sustainable use of environmental, financial, and human resources will be the foundational concepts for this minor. More specifically, the educational component of this minor will provide students with explicit opportunities to engage in the community and develop skills sets to employ a systems approach to achieve a balance of economic development with the conservation of the earth's natural system. This minor will be available to all University of Nebraska–Lincoln students upon approval of individual colleges.</p>
<p class="title-3">Minor Description</p>
<p class="basic-text">The 18 credit hour minor includes 9 credit hours of core courses. Each student chooses an additional 9 credit hours of elective courses from one of three tracks.
