<p class="basic-text">The Department of English seeks to help students develop their critical reading, writing, and thinking skills. In addition, we hope to foster imaginative reasoning, which we define as the ability to use the imagination to think hypothetically about the world in all its diversity—the past, present, and future, the local and the global. Such an ability, learned through the study of diverse literature and film, the critical analysis of language, and the generation of creative work, enables students to thoughtfully engage with social, cultural, and political phenomena. It allows students to re-envision what is possible and to dream audacious solutions to seemingly insoluble problems. Imaginative reasoning, both as a value and as a skill, connects us to one another and leads us to look beyond boundaries, including the boundary of our own selves and our most immediate communities.</p>
<p class="basic-text">As the Department of English at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, we are especially committed to teaching students to pose questions that cut to the core of ongoing conversations about the importance of the Humanities in the twenty-first century. We are keenly aware of our specific place within a university on the Great Plains with a historic land grant mission. We seek to serve the long-term interests of our students and of the various kinds of communities they live in. The courses we offer, our teaching methods, and our departmental culture further several core goals: the pursuit of social justice; the celebration of diversity; the creation of a broad array of communities based on empathetic understanding; the fostering of a sense of belonging in all of our students; and the development of a desire for civic engagement and responsibility.</p>
<p class="basic-text">A student declaring an English major will meet with the advisor to discuss these goals, the learning outcomes of our English Studies program and to establish an individual plan for the major. Thereafter the student should meet with the advisor at least once a year to update the major plan, review progress toward the degree, plan a concentration, and consult about course selection, scholarships, and careers or post-graduate plans. The department Advising Center (201 Andrews Hall) will offer written information about these matters and others of interest to majors.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Special Programs.</span> The Department of English houses the major in Film Studies and participates in the majors in Ethnic Studies, Environmental Studies, and in Womens and Gender Studies; in the minors in African American Studies, U.S. Latina/Latino Studies, Ethnic Studies, Native American Studies, Jewish Studies, Medieval and Renaissance Studies, Environmental Studies, Religious Studies, and Digital Humanities.</p>
<p class="title-2">The Curriculum</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Course Offerings.</span> English courses are regularly offered in drama, poetry, and fiction; periods and authors in British and American literature; women's and minority literatures; creative and expository writing; literary and rhetorical theory and criticism; digital humanities; and film. For the precise courses offered or to be offered in any particular semester, see the Office of the University Registrar's website at registrar.unl.edu for that semester. A course description booklet is also available online before each priority registration period.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Credit Hours.</span> Undergraduate English courses will usually yield 3 semester hours of credit. Graduate-level seminars are usually offered for variable credit (normally 3 or 4 credit hours). The letter suffix H indicates an honors course.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Independent Study.</span> Students must secure permission from a professorial faculty member willing to direct their study and must file an Independent Directed Reading Contract (available in the Advising Center, 201 Andrews Hall) with the undergraduate advisor. This course of study is a provision for students wishing to study in the areas listed above that are insufficiently covered in regularly scheduled classes.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">NOTE:</span> Neither ENGL 495 Internship nor ENGL 497 Independent Study count towards fulfilling 400-level requirements for majors and minors. A maximum of 6 credit hours of ENGL 399 Independent Study and/or ENGL 497 may count towards the 300-level requirement for the major.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Prerequisites.</span> The first course in English is ordinarily chosen from courses numbered 100-151. However, international students who are not native speakers of English normally take English courses such as ENGL 140, ENGL 141, ENGL 142, ENGL 186, ENGL 187, and ENGL 188.</p>
<p class="title-2">Course Levels</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">100 Level.</span> Introductory courses are open only to freshman and sophomore students. Transfer students and others who have not met the communication requirement and are juniors or seniors must choose ENGL 254 or ENGL 354 to complete this requirement. (In unusual cases, exceptions to this rule may be granted by the advisor, English department.) Writing is emphasized in courses numbered 100-199, and all such courses except ENGL 140, ENGL 141, ENGL 142, ENGL 180, ENGL 189H, ENGL 186, and ENGL 187, are designed to fulfill ACE Outcome 1. Newly admitted students who are not native speakers of English must take an English placement examination to determine their appropriate course requirement.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">200 Level.</span> Courses designed for the intermediate student who has completed or is concurrently taking one or two courses in English.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">300 Level.</span> Courses designed for the intermediate student who ordinarily will have had two courses at the 200 level. These students should normally take the remainder of their courses at the 300 level or 400 level. English majors and minors should advance to the 300 level as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">400 Level.</span> Courses designed for the advanced student or the student with a special interest. English majors must take at least 6 credit hours at the 400 level.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">800/900 Level.</span> Graduate courses. Graduate standing and at least 18 hours of undergraduate course work in English are prerequisite to courses at the 800 and 900 level. Advanced undergraduates may register in 800- and 900-level courses with the permission of the Dean of Graduate Studies, provided that these hours do not count towards their baccalaureate requirements.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Work.</span> The advanced degrees of master of arts and doctor of philosophy are offered. For details see the <span class="basic-text-ital">Graduate Studies Bulletin</span>.</p>

<p class="title-1">Tracks/Options/Concentrations/Emphases Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">Concentrations or electives. Students interested in particular areas of study, with particular career goals, or who desire to attend graduate school, should consider developing a concentration to support those interests or aspirations. Students select four courses at the 300 or 400 level that concentrate on a particular area of study. Students may choose one of the department's recommended areas of concentration, or they may design their own concentration in consultation with the advisor and appropriate faculty members. Recommended areas of concentration include:</p>
