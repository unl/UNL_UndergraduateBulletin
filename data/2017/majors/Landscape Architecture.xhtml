<p class="basic-text">Landscape architecture combines the arts and environmental sciences. Landscape architects plan and design spaces and places such as gardens, parks, plazas, streetscapes, residential developments, campuses, cemeteries, commercial districts, resorts, transportation infrastructure, open space networks, towns, corporate and institutional centers and waterfront developments. They also design and plan the restoration of natural places disturbed by humans such as wetlands, stream corridors, mined areas and forested land. Their appreciation for historic landscapes and cultural resources enables landscape architects to undertake preservation planning projects for national, regional and local historic sites and areas.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Collaborating with architects, city planners, civil engineers and other professionals, landscape architects play an important role in environmental sustainability by designing and implementing projects that respect both the needs of people and of our environment. Therefore, landscape architects must be able to understand the process of nature and impact human settlement has on ecosystems. This requires professionals to manage storm water, select appropriate plant material, and anticipate human impact all with an eye on a sustainable and more resilient future.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The goal of the landscape architecture program is to nurture responsible citizens to address the complexity of world issues that face our discipline through creative and transformational design. Students will:</p>
<ul>
<li>achieve academic excellence so qualities of intellectual curiosity, open communication, personal responsibility, collegiality and the skills to work individually and with other’s are held to rigorously high standards;</li>
<li>receive the educational foundation for a professional career instilled with insightful design and planning ability, key technical skills, ethical judgment, and an ever-enhancing understanding of landscape architecture; and</li>
<li>be grounded in a broad base of knowledge within the curriculum, emphasizing connections among subjects that relate to and inform landscape architecture, thereby enabling investigative and problem-solving on all scales in a creative manner.</li>
</ul>
<p class="title-1">General</p>
<p class="basic-text">The accredited landscape architecture program is a four-year course of study that has been subdivided into a one-year pre-professional (d.ONE: Common First Year) and a three-year professional degree. Students receive a professional bachelor of landscape architecture (BLA) at the end of the fourth year. At the end of the Common First Year, students are required to apply for admission into the professional segment of the curriculum. This review involves an evaluation of the student's academic record and a portfolio of their work during the Common First Year. The landscape architecture program is accredited by the Landscape Architectural Accreditation Board (LAAB).</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are required to take an array of courses in support of the core studio sequence in addition to the university’s general education courses. These courses include material in horticulture, environmental sciences, architecture, planning, and site engineering in addition to core landscape architecture studios. This curriculum exposes students to various challenges facing the landscape architecture profession including sustainability, landscape ecology, construction issues, stormwater management, infrastructure and issues created by urbanism.</p>
<p class="title-1">d.ONE: Common First Year</p>
<p class="basic-text">d.ONE engages and prepares students for exciting futures in all design fields within the College of Architecture.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The d.ONE curriculum offered by the College of Architecture, introduces students to design through courses in three areas: Technique (drawing and computer applications), Design Discipline (an introduction to the related design disciplines and design history), and Design Practice (design Thinking and design Making). In addition, students take University courses in math, English, communications, and a general education elective. Design Thinking and Design Making are sequential hands-on courses where students learn to work in teams to address problems and promote innovation. At the same time, they learn the foundational skills in composition, craft, presentation, and idea generation necessary for all design fields.</p>
<p class="basic-text">At the end of d.ONE, students have gained an understanding of the broad range of design and are eligible to apply to any of the design programs in the College—Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Interior Design, and Industrial Design (pending program approval).</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p class="title-1">Specific Major Requirements</p>
<p class="title-2">Pre-Landscape Architecture Curriculum</p>
<p class="basic-text">The pre-landscape curriculum begins with a Common First Year design core. This core introduces students to the fundamentals of design thinking and design making. The pre-landscape architecture program is followed by three years of focused landscape architecture instruction leading to a bachelor of landscape architecture. The professional bachelor of landscape architecture degree is the degree accredited by the Landscape Architectural Accreditation Board (LAAB).</p>
<p class="basic-text">The College of Architecture, and all four years of the landscape architecture program, are located in Lincoln. However, we do offer the option to do the first year of the program at UNO. After successfully completing the prescribed pre-landscape architecture program at UNO, students may transfer to UNL and apply for admission to the second year of study in the professional program of the College of Architecture.</p>
<p class="basic-text">For more information about courses at UNO, or transferring from UNO to UNL, please contact us.</p>

<p class="title-2">GPA Requirements</p>
<p class="title-3">Pre-Professional Program, Architecture, Landscape Architecture and Interior Design</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students in the first year are required to maintain both a semester and cumulative grade point average at or above 2.0. The standard rises to a grade point average of 2.6 in the second year. Admission into the third year of both programs requires a cumulative grade point average of 2.6. The College places students who fail to meet these standards on academic probation.</p>
<p class="title-3">Third and Fourth Year, Interior Design and Landscape Architecture</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students in the third and fourth year of the BLA program are required to maintain a 2.6 cumulative grade point average to remain in good academic standing. The Program places students who fail to meet this standard on academic probation.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">REQUIREMENTS FOR MINOR OFFERED BY DEPARTMENT</p>
<p class="title-1">Minors</p>
<p class="basic-text">The landscape architecture minor is administered through the College of Architecture’s landscape architecture program.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The minor in landscape architecture is designed to provide a basic understanding of the nature of the profession of landscape architecture. Knowledge of landscape architecture history, theory, and context provides a useful addition to a student in any of the University disciplines.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The minor is open to all UNL students. Entrance to the minor is by application, grade review,and permission of the program director, Kim L. Wilson. Contact Leslie Gonzalez, admissions coordinator (232 Architecture Hall West, 402-472-4065, leslie.gonzalez@unl.edu) for the application.</p>
