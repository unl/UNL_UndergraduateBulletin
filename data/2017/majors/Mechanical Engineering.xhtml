<p class="basic-text">Mechanical engineering is a broad field of study that significantly impacts many technologies, including those that expand our energy resources and improve medical care. Mechanical engineers are concerned with all forms of energy conversion and transmission; the flow of fluids and heat; the development, design, manufacturing, and operation of machinery and equipment; material structure and properties; solid and applied mechanics; and transportation processes. The course of study is designed to give the student fundamental preparation to enter the fields of research, design, operation, production, sales, or management.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The mechanical engineering curriculum is structured so that students are well prepared in the fundamental areas of solid mechanics, thermal-fluid sciences, systems and design engineering, and materials engineering. Students can develop an emphasis area of study by concentrating elective courses in specific interdisciplinary areas such as aerospace engineering, automotive engineering, robotics, biomedical engineering, computational methods, manufacturing, nanotechnology and others depending upon the technical courses available and the interest of the student.</p>
<p class="title-2">Mission and Objectives</p>
<p class="title-3">Mission Statement</p>

<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR DEPARTMENT ADMISSION</p>
<p class="title-1">Admittance to Degree Program</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are expected to meet minimum college entrance requirements. After being admitted to the college as pre-mechanical engineering students, students wishing to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering must further be admitted to the degree program. Students who have completed 43 credit hours applicable to their mechanical engineering degree are considered for formal admission to the mechanical engineering degree program. Typically, this occurs the semester the student is enrolled in MECH 200 or MATL 360. Those exceeding 61 credit hours must receive formal admission to the mechanical engineering degree program if they are to continue to take mechanical engineering courses. Transfer students must have at least 12 credit hours of course work from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln on record before an application will be considered.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The requirements for admission to the degree program are a major GPA of 2.7 (that is, not counting elective courses), completion of MECH 223, no more than four withdrawals and no more than three repeated courses. Those who are not admitted to the degree program the first time are advised of the outcome and are automatically reviewed again at the end of that semester. If after two reviews a student is not admitted to the degree program, the student is advised of other majors, in engineering or elsewhere, in which they may be likely to find success.</p>

<p class="content-box-h-1">OTHER</p>
<p class="title-1">Hands-on Opportunities</p>
<p class="basic-text">One major focus of the Department is to provide students with many hands-on opportunities both within the curriculum (through formal laboratory courses) and through extracurricular activities. Brief descriptions of some of the laboratories in the department are given below.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">The Materials Laboratory</span> is designed to study the development of microstructures during processing, and to correlate the properties of materials with the observed structures. Undergraduates utilize arc melting facilities for solidification processing and alloy formation, rolling mills for deformation processing, and a variety of furnaces for thermal treatments. Characterization facilities include x-ray diffractometry and optical microscopy, while property measurements are completed using hardness testing (including microhardness), tensile testing, and impact testing facilities. Other facilities associated with the materials laboratory include rapid solidification processing facilities and electron microscopy facilities.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">The Measurements Laboratory</span> is associated with the required MECH 380 Mechanical Engineering Measurements course which includes two hours of lecture and two hours of laboratory work each week. The course covers the fundamentals of mechanical engineering measurements including data analysis (statistics, graphing, spectral analysis), signal conditioning, data readout, and the measurement of length/displacement, rate of rotation, stress/strain, temperature, pressure, fluid velocity, fluid flow rate, vibration/acceleration, and sound. The MECH 380 Lab has four workbenches. Each workbench has a set of basic measurement equipment including a digital oscilloscope, an electronic counter, a digital multimeter, a DC power supply, a function generator, and a computer-based data acquisition system consisting of a personal computer with data acquisition software and interfaced analog-to-digital converter and digital counter cards. In addition, on a week-to-week basis, specialized equipment is brought out of the cabinets and set up for each of the nine (some one week, some two week) labs.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">The Kinematics and Machine Design Laboratory</span> is a teaching laboratory for undergraduate students. The laboratory consists of equipment and instruments for conducting experiments in kinematics and machine design. One piece of major equipment is the rapid prototyping machine, which accepts design specifications from a computer and forms a prototype of the design using plastic fused deposition. This machine provides the student with experience in design integration from concept to product. Accessories in this laboratory include desktop computers, a wide-carriage printer, and other instruments. Kawasaki also donated a retired robot that is now utilized in this laboratory.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">The Thermal Fluids Laboratory</span> involves design, execution and evaluation of physical experiments in the areas of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer. There are three major, heavily-instrumented experiments: 1) a two stage air-compressor with intercooling, 2) a versatile air conditioning unit, and 3) a Ford gasoline engine with a Superflow water brake dynamometer, supported with a data acquisition system. The course involves design, execution and evaluation of physical experiments in the areas of thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer. In addition, the facilities include “table top” instrumentation for viscosity measurement, measurement of pressure distribution on an airfoil, flow visualization and head loss across a valve on which students conduct experiments.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">The Mechatronics Laboratory</span> is well-equipped for teaching courses in mechatronics, robotics, and controls. It is used primarily for MECH 457 and MECH 450, but is also used for other courses, and by both undergraduate and graduate students working on research projects. The laboratory contains desktop computers, modular robots, digital oscilloscopes, function generators, computer controllers, soldering systems, and many other accessories.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph">The Department also has computational facilities available to students. The computer lab has a suite of personal computers with a full complement of computing resources available to students.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Research Laboratories.</span> These laboratories, extensions of those described above, are equipped for research in the fields of fluid mechanics, heat transfer, thermodynamics, turbulence, flow visualization, fluid mechanics, measurements, turbomachinery and engine research, combustion, materials, mechanical design, dynamics, computational, solid and applied mechanics, biomedical engineering, and controls. Many of our undergraduate students gain valuable experience working on research projects under the guidance of professors. These are funded by research grants or the University’s UCARE program.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph">Some of the extracurricular opportunities for students to gain hands-on engineering experience include SAE Baja, SAE Formula (both through Husker Motorsports), NASA microgravity, AIAA competitions, and others.</p>            </div>
