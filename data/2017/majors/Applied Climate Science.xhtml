<p class="basic-text">Applied climate professionals are active in assessing climate risk, informing decision makers, working with policy makers, and providing climate information to private and public sectors. The ACS major will provide a foundation for understanding the climate system and its components, as well as interactions of the climate system components with, and impacts on, the environment and human activities. Upon the completion of the major, graduates will be prepared to address applied climate science issues such as climate change and climate variability.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The goal of the major is to provide a higher level of understanding in climatology in order to understand complex climate-based problems and their interrelationships with natural resources and ecosystem management issues that are pervasive today and will become even more important in the future. Issues such as natural hazard management, climate change, climate variability, changing frequency and severity of extreme climate events, environmental degradation, deforestation, and increased demand for water and other natural resources are at the root of this increased demand for applied climate professionals.</p>
<p class="basic-text">With a professional degree in Applied Climate Science graduates will have met the curriculum recommended by the American Association of State Climatologists. A minimum of 120 credit hours is required for the bachelor of science degree. Of these requirements, 32 credits are in an applied climate sciences curriculum designed to provide the foundation in meteorology and climatology. The applied climate science degree program also requires 30 credit hours of science and mathematics. Students select a specialization consisting of 22-23 credit hours, allowing students to develop an individualized area of study; the specialization is designed by the student in consultation with an advisor. Possible focus areas include but are not limited to Agroecosystems, Geospatial Techniques, Hazard Assessment, Human Dimensions and Environmental Policy, Livestock and Wildlife, and Water Resources. To complete the degree, the student must take 21 credit hours of communication, humanities and social science courses.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students who successfully fulfill the requirements for the Applied Climate Science major are prepared for many career options. Opportunities include positions with environmental and climate consulting firms, planning agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and governmental agencies addressing climate issues. Additionally, students may major in ACS to fulfill a pre-professional degree requirement. The program also provides students the opportunity to prepare for graduate study in applied climate sciences and other related fields.</p>
