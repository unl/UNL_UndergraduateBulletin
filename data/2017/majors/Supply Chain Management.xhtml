<p class="basic-text">The College of Business Administration at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln has established an undergraduate supply chain management major to educate students to become supply chain management professionals. Supply chain management (SCM) includes all the activities that must take place to get the right products and services into the right customer’s hands in the right quantity at the right time—from raw material extraction to consumer purchase.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The topics that SCM covers are diverse and include: procurement, order fulfillment, inventory management, supplier relationship management, product development and commercialization, returns management, physical distribution and shipping, warehousing, and outsourcing. With the depth and breadth of issues that it encompasses, industries that use SCM tools and approaches include: transportation, hospitals, government organizations, construction, processing, social services, electronics, facility design, manufacturing, and warehousing.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The course work for the supply chain management major (bachelor of science in business administration) consists of 120 credit hours, 33 of which are specific to the major. A focus of the course work is developing the three foundational areas of supply chain management: procurement, logistics, and operations. The program offers integration among these critical, value-adding components to enhance global competitiveness. Twenty-one hours of required course work is intended to provide students with an understanding of supply chain and logistic activities, development of strong quantitative and analytic skills, and introduction to tools to explore and improve a system. Students will complete an additional 12 hours of course work from directed electives in supporting fields such as accounting, economics, finance, management, or marketing.</p>
