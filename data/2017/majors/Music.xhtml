<p class="basic-text">The music major is available in two degree programs. Both include the opportunity to take applied lessons with highly acclaimed faculty artists and scholars, as well as a compulsory foundation in music theory and history, keyboard skills, and ensemble participation.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students choosing the bachelor of arts degree can expect a substantial amount of musical study encompassing about three years. This degree consists of six successive semesters of applied lessons, culminating with a junior recital in the sixth semester. Alternatively, those who want to pursue research in music may present a reseach project or document in lieu of the junior recital and last semester of applied lessons.  The BA degree requires that a minor area of study be included in the program of studies.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students wishing to take a course of study in music that will prepare them for graduate study and eventually a professional career in music theory, music history, composition, piano pedagogy, or performance, should take a bachelor of music degree. The bachelor of music degree is recommended for students who have the desire and capacity to reach high standards of achievement in performance study. Students with creative talent may pursue courses in composition and develop their abilities as composers. Music scholars will want to increase their understanding of the history and/or theory of music by pursuing the music history or music theory options. The performance options include eight successive semesters of applied lessons and culminate with a senior recital.</p>

<p class="title-3">Part II - Musicianship</p>
<p class="basic-text">Faculty evaluate the student’s performance to determine if the student may continue as a music major.</p>
<p class="title-3">Evaluation</p>
<p class="basic-text">The UDQJ is judged Pass/No Pass, with pass meaning that the student’s basic musical skills and musicianship are judged to be at least minimal for his/her instrument. The jury members in each area will use a general consensus approach in determining Pass/No Pass. A no pass on the UDQJ will indicate an interpretation by the faculty that the student has not completed the requirements for the Upper Divisional Qualifying Jury, resulting in a formal grade of <span class="basic-text-bold">incomplete</span>. The student then has two additional juries to remove the incomplete. The student may continue to register for applied study at the 200 level for a maximum of two semesters until the incomplete is removed. After one year, the incomplete will expire, causing the grade to revert to a D or F. If the student passes the re-take before the beginning of the 2nd week of classes, he/she will be permitted to register for 300-level applied music courses for that semester.</p>
<p class="basic-text"><span class="basic-text-bold">NOTE:</span> A re-examination will be scheduled only during the first week of classes following a semester in which the UDQJ was failed or during regular scheduled jury times at the end of a semester.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The status of music major is provisional, pending a satisfactory completion of the UDQJ. The result of the UDQJ is validated on the <span class="basic-text-bold">UDQJ JURY</span> form with faculty signatures, and filed in the music office.</p>
<p class="title-1">Grade Rules</p>
<p class="title-2">C- and D Grades</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students must earn grades of C or better in these courses. Any course in which a student earns a grade of C- or below must be repeated in order to count toward the requirement.</p>
<p class="title-2">Pass/No Pass Limits</p>
<p class="basic-text">All courses taken to fulfill music major or minor requirements must be taken for a grade (except those only offered as Pass/No Pass).</p>
<p class="title-1">Extended Education, Independent Study Rules, Internship Credit Rules, Transfer Credit used in Major Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">The following will be used by advisors as guidelines for the evaluation of transfer credits that are less than five years old:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a transfer student has successfully completed (grade C or above) approved transfer credits that are <span class="basic-text-bold">equivalent</span> to NU area requirements in terms of number of credit hours and scope of content, that area will be considered completed at the discretion of the chief degree program advisor.</li>
<li>For approved transfer credits which are <span class="basic-text-bold">lacking equivalency</span> in either number of credit hours, scope of content, or grade received to NU area requirements in applied music, music theory, sight singing/aural skills, and keyboard skills, the number of transfer credits accepted and placement in the NU area will be determined by audition/proficiency tests administered by designated area faculty.</li>
<li>For approved transfer credits that are lacking equivalency in other music areas (history and ensembles), the number of transfer credits accepted will be determined by the chief degree program advisor.</li>
</ul>
<p class="header-paragraph">All music course work that is <span class="basic-text-bold">more than five years old</span> must be validated by an audition or competency examination given by designated area faculty.</p>

<p class="title-2">MUDC/MUCO/MUNM</p>
<p class="basic-text">Music Ensembles for Degree Credit (MUDC) are exclusively for music majors and minors to fulfill music requirements. One, and only one, ensemble must be enrolled as MUDC each term in which the student is involved in major or minor courses. Additional ensembles taken in a given semester by music majors or minors should be registered as Music Ensembles for Elective Credit Only (MUCO).</p>
<p class="basic-text">Other students (without a major or minor in music) participating in an ensemble in a given semester must register for a minimum of one Music for Non-Majors (MUNM) credit. Students who are taking applied lessons and are participating in more than one ensemble during the same semester have the option to take the additional ensembles(s) for zero credit using a MUCO ensemble number. Zero-credit enrollment will not be allowed for students who are not taking applied lessons.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Ensemble registrations may be repeated for credit. Ensembles taken in excess of major requirements will only count as electives.</p>

The ensembles listed under the MUDC listing are the only ensembles that will fulfill the degree requirements. Only 1 credit under the MUDC listing may be taken per semester.
