<p class="basic-text">Philosophy is the critical study of the fundamental concepts and assumptions involved in all central areas of human experience, including religion, morality, science, and art. The department offers an introduction to philosophy course designed for the general student, as well as introductory courses in logic and current issues.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The basic philosophy curriculum includes courses in the <span class="basic-text-ital">history of philosophy</span> covering the period which begins with the development of rational inquiry by the philosophers of ancient Greece and which concludes with the construction of the modern philosophical systems of the Enlightenment as well as courses in each of the major fields of philosophical study: <span class="basic-text-ital">ethics</span>, which is concerned with the basis of morality; <span class="basic-text-ital">metaphysics</span>, which explores different views about what fundamentally exists; <span class="basic-text-ital">epistemology</span>, which examines the nature and limits of human knowledge; and <span class="basic-text-ital">logic</span>, which studies general methods of reasoned argument and analysis.</p>
<p class="basic-text">A number of courses reflect the role of philosophy in investigating the fundamental concepts and assumptions of other disciplines, including courses in medical ethics, the philosophy of law, the philosophy of science, and the philosophy of mathematics.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Other courses focus on the role of philosophy in the critical analysis of basic evaluative conceptions and assumptions. Courses in political philosophy critically examine the evaluative concepts and assumptions involved in our beliefs about government, individual liberty, and social and economic justice. Courses in the philosophy of religion do the same for beliefs about the nature and existence of God and about the relations between faith and knowledge.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The department also offers courses in <span class="basic-text-ital">aesthetics</span>, the philosophical study of art, music, and literature understood as fundamental forms of human culture and significant expressions of the human spirit.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The interdisciplinary character of philosophy, together with its focus on evaluative issues and its unique emphasis on general methods of reasoned argument and analysis, leads to an unusually broad and intellectually sound major for students preparing themselves for such professions as law, medicine, social work, government service, and the ministry. The philosophy major is indispensable for those who wish to prepare for a career as a philosopher within a college or university setting.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students interested in majoring in philosophy or in selecting philosophy courses specially relevant to their studies are invited to visit with the advisor for the department or the department chair.</p>
<p class="basic-text"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Pre-Law Students.</span> Pre-law students may benefit especially from courses in logic (PHIL 110, PHIL 211), philosophy of law (PHIL 230), ethics and political philosophy (PHIL 221, PHIL 320, PHIL 325), and theory of knowledge (PHIL 301).</p>
