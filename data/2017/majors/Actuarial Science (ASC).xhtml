<p class="basic-text">An actuary is a mathematically-oriented business person who will most likely be a manager or supervisor at some point in his/her career. A course of study culminating in a bachelor of science degree with a major in actuarial science is an excellent educational background for prospective actuaries. Additional information is available at www.BeAnActuary.org.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The actuarial science program is designed to prepare students for the current industry demands. Because the demands change on a regular basis, often times, the number of hours, the sequencing of courses, and the specific requirements change for this major. Students should continue to consult with the department for the appropriate selection and listing of course requirements.</p>
<p class="basic-text">All actuarial science students are encouraged to visit the actuarial science programâ€™s website (http://cba.unl.edu/academics/actuarial/) and an actuarial science program faculty advisor for more information about the program, including the Actuarial Science Club, sequencing of courses, scholarship opportunities, and the requirements for achieving professional actuarial designations.</p>
<p class="basic-text">See the College of Business Administration section of this bulletin for a description of the major in that college.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
