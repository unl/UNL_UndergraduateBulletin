<p class="basic-text">The energy science minor is designed to offer an educational component to University of Nebraska students that will prepare them with the knowledge, expertise, and background to successfully compete for positions with companies that are producing or developing renewable energy sources or conventional fossil fuels sources or with organizations that manage energy use or the environmental impacts of energy use. The minor is for students who desire a broad understanding of energy-related issues and an in-depth knowledge of energy in one or more of four elective thematic areas as well as for those seeking employment in agriculture, business/industry, communication, transportation, and government.</p>
<p class="title-2">Courses of Instruction (ENSC)</p>
<p class="basic-text">Courses suitable for automatic inclusion in one of the four elective thematic areas have been identified and can be viewed at the website http://energysciences.unl.edu/tracks. Any of the above ENSC courses can be taken independently as desired by any student.</p>
<p class="basic-text">A student in consultation with an academic advisor will submit a "College-Degree-Major-Advisor Change Form" (CDMA) declaring their intent to complete the minor before the deadline for submitting the application for graduation. The degree audit system of the University Registrar will evaluate whether the appropriate courses have been taken for completion of the minor. The minor will be recorded on the student’s transcript upon graduation.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">REQUIREMENTS FOR MINOR OFFERED BY DEPARTMENT</p>
<p class="basic-text">A minor in energy science (ENSC) will include a minimum of 18 credit hours of energy-related courses including four core courses.</p>
