<p class="basic-text">The College of Architecture also administers the interior design program. The four-year interior design program consists of a one-year pre-interior design program and a subsequent three-year bachelor of science in design (BSD-Interior Design) major. After completing a one-year curriculum in pre-interior design, students apply for admission into the College of Architecture’s interior design program. This interior design program is fully accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA). The interior design program also offers a post-professional MS degree through the Graduate College. The graduate degree is also available through On-line and Distance Education.</p>
<p class="basic-text">This four-year, undergraduate program is for the student interested in becoming a professional interior designer. The professional interior designer is a person qualified by education, experience, and examination to 1) identify, research, and creatively explore issues related to the quality of the interior environment; 2) perform design services in interior spaces, including programming, design analysis, space planning and aesthetics, using specialized knowledge of interior construction, building systems and components, building codes, equipment materials and furnishings; and 3) prepare drawings and documents describing the design of interior spaces in order to enhance and protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Upon successful completion of one year of pre-interior design studies and admission to the interior design program, students in the interior design program may enroll in the curriculum which leads to a bachelor of science in design (BSD-Interior Design) degree.</p>
<p class="title-1">d.ONE: The Common First Year</p>
<p class="basic-text">d.ONE engages and prepares students for exciting futures in all design fields within the College of Architecture.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The d.ONE curriculum offered by the College of Architecture, introduces students to design through courses in three areas: Technique (drawing and computer applications), Design Discipline (an introduction to the related design disciplines and design history), and Design Practice (design Thinking and design Making). In addition, students take University courses in math, English, communications, and a general education elective. Design Thinking and Design Making are sequential hands-on courses where students learn to work in teams to address problems and promote innovation. At the same time, they learn the foundational skills in composition, craft, presentation, and idea generation necessary for all design fields.</p>
<p class="basic-text">At the end of d.ONE, students have gained an understanding of the broad range of design and are eligible to apply to any of the design programs in the College—Architecture, Landscape Architecture, Interior Design, and Industrial Design (pending program approval).</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p class="title-1">Pre-Interior Design Curriculum</p>
<p class="basic-text">The pre-interior design curriculum begins with a one-year design core. This core introduces students to the fundamentals of design thinking and design making. The pre-interior design program is followed by three years of interior design instruction leading to a bachelor of science in design–interior design. The interior design program is fully accredited by the Council for Interior Design Accreditation (CIDA).</p>
<p class="basic-text">The College of Architecture, and all four years of the interior design program, are located in Lincoln. However, we do offer the option to do the first year of the program at UNO. After successfully completing the prescribed pre-interior design program at UNO, students may transfer to UNL and apply for admission to the second year of study in the professional program of the Interior Design Program. For more information about courses at UNO, or transferring from UNO to UNL, please contact Lindsey Bahe at 402-472-0033 (UNL) or Leslie Gonzalez at 402-472-4065.</p>

<p class="title-1">Grade Rules</p>
<p class="title-2">Minimum Grades</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students must earn at least a C (2.0) in all courses with an ARCH, DSGN, IDES, or LARC prefix to earn credit toward their degree. Students will be required to retake all core required courses with a grade of C- or below, but will not be required to repeat courses that were taken as electives.</p>
<p class="title-2">Pass/No Pass Limits</p>
<p class="basic-text">None of the required classes offered in the professional program are offered Pass/No Pass, but a maximum of 12 Pass/No Pass credit hours of humanities, social sciences, or open electives may be taken from departments outside the College of Architecture.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Courses taken outside the architecture, landscape architecture, or interior design programs to fulfill the upper level outside elective requirement at the 800 level or 900 level, with or without a 400-level counterpart, in a minor, collateral, or supporting area of work, can be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis.</p>
<p class="title-2">GPA Requirements</p>
<p class="title-3">Pre-Professional Program, Architecture, Landscape Architecture and Interior Design</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students in the first year are required to maintain both a semester and cumulative grade point average at or above 2.0. The standard rises to a grade point average of 2.6 in the second year. Admission into the third year of both programs requires a cumulative grade point average of 2.6. The College places students who fail to meet these standards on academic probation.</p>
<p class="title-3">Third and Fourth Year, Interior Design and Landscape Architecture</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students in the third and fourth year of the BSD program are required to maintain a 2.6 cumulative grade point average to remain in good academic standing. The program places students who fail to meet this standard on academic probation.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">REQUIREMENTS FOR MINOR OFFERED BY DEPARTMENT</p>
<p class="title-1">Product Design Minor</p>

<p class="title-2">Product Design</p>
<p class="basic-text">The common core of courses shared by students in the College of Architecture (interior design, architecture, landscape architecture) provides students with an understanding of the design and fabrication process at a range of scales. The minor in product design provides an opportunity to explore design at a smaller, yet related scale. It allows students to develop academic strengths that will prepare them for advanced study and careers in the design of objects that people interact with on a personal level, of a size and function related to human dimensions. This includes furniture and a variety of manufactured objects.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The minor is available to students in interior design, architecture, landscape architecture, and art.</p>
<p class="title-2">Requirements for the Minor (18 credits)</p>
