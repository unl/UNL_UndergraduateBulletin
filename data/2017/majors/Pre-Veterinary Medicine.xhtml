<p class="faculty-list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">Director: Donald L. Reynolds</span>, School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, 120C Vet Basic Sciences</p>

<p class="basic-text">Individuals wishing to pursue a career as a veterinarian must earn a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) degree or its equivalent from an accredited school or college of veterinary medicine (S/CVM). Qualification for admission to a S/CVM includes the successful completion of a pre-veterinary medicine program (PVET). The PVET program includes academic and non-academic requirements. This listing focuses on academic requirements. Non-academic requirements may be found on individual S/CVM websites.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Academic requirements are published on individual S/CVM websites, which include specific undergraduate courses required for admission and PVET academic performance standards. College-level courses that meet PVET requirements are specified by each S/CVM. The focus of the UNL PVET program is on courses required for admission to the Professional Program in Veterinary Medicine (PPVM), a cooperative program between the University of Nebraska–Lincoln and Iowa State University. However, it may be modified to help a student qualify for admission to any S/CVM.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The UNL PVET program is not a degree-granting program. Expect it to take 2-3 years to complete it.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Pass/No Pass credits are not accepted. PVET courses must be taken for a grade, unless the course is only offered Pass/No Pass.</p>
<p class="basic-text">A grade of a C or better is necessary to fulfill the PVET requirement. If a course is repeated to obtain a higher grade or to earn a grade of C or better, the average of all grades earned for that course will be included in the admission assessment.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The acceptability of AP, CLEP, or IB earned credits varies by S/CVM and each S/CVM publishes its policy on its website.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Each PVET student is encouraged to pursue a baccalaureate degree in a degree program of his or her choice concurrent with pursuing the PVET program. Individuals with a baccalaureate degree need only to complete the PVET program requirements to qualify for admission to a S/CVM.</p>

<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">NOTE:</span> What follows fulfills the PVET requirements for the Professional Program in Veterinary Medicine (PPVM), a cooperative program between the University of Nebraska–Lincoln and Iowa State University. Criteria for admission to that program may be found on the PPVM website at http://vetmed.unl.edu/prospectivestudents. Students planning to attend other veterinary schools must check with those schools to determine if there are any differences between the other veterinary school and the PPVM PVET requirements.</p>
