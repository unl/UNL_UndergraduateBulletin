<p class="faculty-list"><span class="faculty-list-bold">Coordinator: Arts and Sciences Advising Center</span>, 107 Oldfather Hall</p>
<p class="basic-text">The College of Arts and Sciences major or minor in Individualized Program of Studies allows a student to design an academic program to pursue a special interest not covered by the established majors or minors offered by the College. A proposal must be interdisciplinary, (that is, come from more than one department), and center on a clearly defined problem area, a defined body of thought, a specific area of interest, or a specific educational goal. The program is not intended to allow students to graduate without concentrating their thoughts in some clearly defined pattern. Students intending to pursue graduate work should be sure that this particular program will meet admission requirements. Students also should be sure that the University has the resources (faculty interest and expertise) to support the anticipated Individualized Program of Studies major. Each major or minor is essentially “custom-made” to meet specific individual needs. However, the following list of titles of approved programs gives an idea of some of the opportunities: biomedical illustration, adolescent studies, language studies, neuroscience and behavior, and hospital administration.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students with interests or educational objectives that cannot be met by a traditional major or minor, span more than one of the College’s traditional departmental divisions, and whose interests and objectives can be expressed in terms of some defined problem area or topic are encouraged to consider this major or minor option. For more information, interested students should contact the Arts and Sciences Academic and Career Advising Center, 107 Oldfather Hall.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Procedure.</span> An Individualized Program of Studies form and information sheet is available in the Arts and Sciences Academic and Career Advising Center, 107 Oldfather Hall, along with advisors who can answer general questions about the process and program. The student must find a faculty member from the core department in Arts and Sciences to act as the advisor. The student and the  advisor are responsible for coordinating the program with other concerned departments. The proposal, with a title, description and justification for the topic, must be approved and signed by the student, advisor and the core department chair before being turned into the Arts and Sciences Advising Center for review by the Director of Advising before being approved by vote of the College Curriculum and Advising Committee. The program must be approved by the College Curriculum and Advising Committee before the student completes 90 of the 120 applicable hours toward the degree.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">NOTE:</span> Individualized Program of Studies (IPS) is a major or minor. Therefore, all other University and College degree requirements must be fulfilled in addition to the IPS.</p>
