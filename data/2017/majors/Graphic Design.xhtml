<p class="basic-text">The graphic design major prepares students to integrate creativity with visual communication to create a wide variety of print and digital products. The School of Art, Art History and Design offers two undergraduate degrees for this major. Both include a solid base of knowledge in the principles and history of art and design. The bachelor of arts (BA) degree, with nearly fifty percent of its courses in the major, requires students to complement this foundation with another area of study. The bachelor of fine arts (BFA) degree expands on the basic course work by providing additional experience in graphic design and related studio art areas. This intensive degree holds seventy percent of its courses in the major and is intended for those who want to work in a design career or pursue graduate study in graphic design.</p>
