<p class="basic-text">Architects are creative problem solvers. The primary responsibility of the architectural profession is the design of meaningful, productive environments for human occupation and use. Architects, therefore, must be able to understand the needs and desires of the people who will inhabit and use their creations and effectively synthesize the complex structural, mechanical, constructional components, and cultural references that influence the design of a building. As designers, they must possess creative and aesthetic skills as well as technical knowledge, collaborative ability, and problem-solving agility.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The architecture program seeks to increase students’ desire to learn and to develop a capacity for design-thinking and sound, critical judgment while simultaneously developing their creative potential. Specifically, the curriculum provides the background and means for the student to:</p>
<p class="list">1. Analyze and understand society’s needs and desires,</p>
<p class="list">2. Translate these needs and desires into a physical form and spatial organization,</p>
<p class="list">3. Contribute creatively to the building construction industry,</p>
<p class="list">4. Search out new problems and contribute to environmental knowledge through design-research,</p>
<p class="list">5. Initiate and review developments in technology and society, and</p>
<p class="list">6. Participate in the community that makes decisions affecting the physical environment.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Architecture is a six-year course of study divided into a pre-professional common first year (d.ONE) and a professional program of study. Students choosing to study architecture first enter the College as majors in pre-architecture. After completing a one-year introductory design curriculum common to all undergraduates in the College of Architecture, students apply for admission into the architecture program’s professional program. The professional program in architecture consists of two components: the three-year <span class="basic-text-bold">B</span><span class="basic-text-bold">achelor of </span><span class="basic-text-bold">S</span><span class="basic-text-bold">cience in </span><span class="basic-text-bold">D</span><span class="basic-text-bold">esign</span> (BSD-Architecture) and the subsequent two-year <span class="basic-text-bold">M</span><span class="basic-text-bold">aster of </span><span class="basic-text-bold">A</span><span class="basic-text-bold">rchitecture</span> (M.Arch).</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students in good standing at the completion of the BSD-Architecture are admitted to the M.Arch program without application.</p>
<p class="basic-text">In the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accreditation Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture, recognizes three types of degrees: the bachelor of architecture, the master of architecture and the doctor of architecture. A program may be granted up to an 8-year term of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational standards.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Masters degree programs may consist of an undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree, that, when earned sequentially, constitute an accredited professional education. However, the undergraduate degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The professional master of architecture degree is fully accredited by the National Architectural Accreditation Board (NAAB). The architecture program at UNL was granted 8-year reaccreditation in July 2015.</p>
<p class="basic-text">In addition to the 58 credit hour, two-year professional M.Arch program, <span class="basic-text-bold">applicants with degrees from other fields may be eligible to enter the three year, 92 credit hour master of architecture program with deficiencies.</span> These deficiencies are evaluated by the program director on an individual basis after admission resulting from a review of the applicant’s transcripts and other pertinent professionally-related materials by the Student Affairs Committee.</p>
<p class="basic-text">For those who would like to pursue scholarship and research in architecture, the architecture program also offers a 36 credit hour, scholarly-nonprofessional <span class="basic-text-bold">m</span><span class="basic-text-bold">aster of </span><span class="basic-text-bold">s</span><span class="basic-text-bold">cience in architecture degree for students with a bachelors degree in architecture or a related discipline</span>.</p>
<p class="title-1">The Master of Architecture Professional Program</p>
<p class="title-2">General</p>
<p class="basic-text">The professional program in architecture is a six-year course of study that includes a one-year pre-professional segment, a three-year core segment culminating in the award of the Bachelor of Science in Design (BSD) and culminates in the final two-year exploratory segment which results in the receipt of the professional Master of Architecture degree (M.Arch).</p>
<p class="basic-text">Although the Bachelor of Science in Design degree is an integral part of the five-year professional program in architecture, it should be clearly understood that the undergraduate BSD is not a professional degree and is not separately accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board. Most state registration boards will not acknowledge any degree unless accompanied by an accredited professional degree.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The accredited, first professional degree awarded by the College of Architecture is the <span class="basic-text-bold">M</span><span class="basic-text-bold">aster of </span><span class="basic-text-bold">A</span><span class="basic-text-bold">rchitecture</span> degree which is awarded at the successful conclusion of the professional program in architecture. This is the only accredited professional architecture program in the state of Nebraska.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Upon successful completion of the one-year pre-architecture program, students who have been admitted to the second year may enroll in the curriculum that leads to the BSD degree and the M.Arch degree.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The professional program in architecture is structured to develop highly competent professional architects capable of performing effectively in an evolving discipline.</p>
<p class="title-1">d.ONE: The Common First Year</p>
<p class="basic-text">d.ONE, the common first year, engages and prepares students for exciting futures in all design fields within the College of Architecture.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The d.ONE curriculum offered by the College of Architecture, introduces students to design through courses in three areas: Technique (drawing and computer applications), Design Discipline (an introduction to the related design disciplines and design history), and Design Practice (design Thinking and design Making). In addition, students take University courses in math (calculus), English, communications, and a general education elective. Design Thinking and design Making are sequential hands-on courses in which students learn to work in teams to address problems and promote innovation. At the same time, they learn the foundational skills in composition, craft, presentation, and idea generation necessary for all design fields.</p>
<p class="basic-text">At the end of the d.ONE common first year, students have gained an understanding of the broad range of design and are eligible to apply to any of the design programs in the College—architecture, landscape architecture, interior design, and industrial design (pending program approval.)</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">ADMISSION</p>
<p class="title-1">Admission to the Architecture Program</p>
<p class="basic-text">After completion of the first year of pre-architecture studies, either within the College of Architecture or at another institution, students may apply for admission to the professional architecture program.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Pre-architecture students should apply for admission to the professional program in architecture. Successful applicants will have their major changed from pre-architecture to BSD-Architecture option.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Available teaching resources and space capacities limit enrollment to the second year of architectural studies; therefore enrollment limits are established each semester.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Required courses must be completed before advancing to the next year of study.</p>
<p class="title-2">Minimum Entrance Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">To be considered for admission to the architecture program, applicants must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be enrolled in the College of Architecture</li>
<li>Be in good scholastic standing</li>
<li>Have completed the one year pre-architecture program of study.</li>
</ul>
<p class="title-1">Second Year Admission Process</p>
<p class="list">1. An application for admission may be completed by filling out the online application. The program receives applications once a year on March 1.</p>
<p class="list">2. Applicants must submit a portfolio conforming to the defined criteria for the program applied for by the date posted at the completion of the spring semester.</p>
<p class="list">3. Any applicant who has previously applied for admission and has not been accepted or who fails to enroll in the professional program in architecture after an acceptance must reapply in the regular manner. Students may apply for admission to the architecture program only three times.</p>
<p class="title-2">Evaluation</p>
<p class="basic-text">The Student Affairs Committee of the Architecture Program will carefully evaluate all applications for admission. The committee considers three elements in their evaluation; cumulative grade point average, a weighted grade point average, and the portfolio of student work. The weighted grade point average gives additional value to the applicant’s achievement in the required DSGN prefix course or transfer equivalents in the pre-professional curriculum.</p>
<p class="title-2">Selection</p>
<p class="basic-text">Admission to the architecture program will be awarded to applicants who show the greatest professional potential and have demonstrated scholastic achievement. The Student Affairs Committee reserves the right to not fill all available spaces in the professional program in architecture if it determines that the remaining applicants have not performed at an acceptable level.</p>
<p class="title-1">Admission to the 2-Year Master of Architecture Program</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students having completed the BSD-Architecture may continue their studies culminating in the M.Arch without re-application provided they exhibit a cumulative grade point average of B (3.0) and a studio GPA of B (3.0). Students must submit an intent form with a brief statement of purpose. A portfolio is not required. Students wishing to be eligible for fellowships and assistantships must submit the form by February 1. Fellowships and assistantships have separate applications.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students from outside the program must apply to gain admission to the 2-year M.Arch degree program. Applications are available in October from the department office and are reviewed once a year in February. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is not required.</p>
<p class="basic-text">All applications for admission are subject to approval of the Student Affairs Committee. Enrollment shall be limited by the teaching resources and space capacities of the department. An enrollment quota is established prior to each admissions cycle.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students in the professional program are governed by the rules, procedures and policies established in the architecture program. These are published in the Student Guide or by official notification by the faculty.</p>
<p class="title-2">Minimum Entrance Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">To be considered for admission to the 2-year professional program in architecture, applicants must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a 4-year degree from an accreditation-leading architecture program</li>
<li>Present a portfolio of design work</li>
<li>Be in good scholastic standing</li>
<li>Have a B average or its equivalent in past academic programs.</li>
</ul>
<p class="basic-text">The Student Affairs Committee of the architecture program requires a minimum TOEFL score of 550 or 213 computer-based or Internet-based score of 79-80 for all international student applicants whose first language is not English.</p>
<p class="title-2">Evaluation</p>
<p class="basic-text">A portfolio of an applicant’s recent design work will be evaluated by the Student Affairs Committee of the architecture program and is considered to be a very important part of the application review process, along with the applicant’s educational profile, letters of recommendation, transcripts, and application form.</p>
<p class="title-2">Selection</p>
<p class="basic-text">The limited number of spaces available each semester will be awarded to applicants who have displayed the highest abilities in a combination of scholastic achievement, design capability, and professional potential. Strong applicants with significant deficiencies may be admitted to the 3-year M.Arch program.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The admissions committee reserves the right to reject applicants who, in its opinion, have not reached an acceptable level of design proficiency.</p>
<p class="title-1">Admission to the 3-Year Master of Architecture Program</p>
<p class="title-2">Minimum Entrance Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">To be considered for admission to the 3-year M.Arch program, applicants must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a four-year bachelor degree in any field</li>
<li>Have a B (3.0) cumulative grade point average in past academic programs</li>
<li>Have completed one semester (3 cr) college calculus</li>
<li>Have completed one semester (3 cr) college physics</li>
</ul>
<p>Experience in art or design is recommended but not required for admission.</p>
<p>The Student Affairs Committee requires a minimum TOEFL score of 550 or 213 computer-based or Internet-based score of 79-80 for all international student applicants whose first language is not English.</p>
<p class="title-2">Evaluation</p>
<p class="basic-text">The Student Affairs Committee evaluates the candidate’s past academic record, three letters of recommendation, a statement of educational goals and the information requested on the application form. A portfolio is not required for candidates applying for the three year masters degree program, however, providing evidence of past achievements and/or creative activity is helpful to the committee in its evaluation.</p>
<p class="title-2">Selection</p>
<p class="basic-text">The limited number of spaces available each semester will be awarded to applicants who have displayed the highest abilities in a combination of scholastic achievement and professional potential.</p>
<p class="title-2">Deficiencies</p>
<p class="basic-text">The Student Affairs Committee and/or the program chair reserve the right to require additional course work be done to correct perceived deficiencies in the candidates educational background. Examples of common deficiencies include college calculus, basic design, and computer applications. Courses fulfilling these requirements are available at the University of Nebraska and may be taken in the summer preceding the first year of the program.</p>
<p class="title-2">Advanced Standing</p>
<p class="basic-text">Advanced standing may be granted to exceptional individuals with bachelors degrees in related fields. Advanced standing would allow students to waive one design research studio. To be eligible for advanced standing, applicants must submit a portfolio for review.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p class="title-1">Pre-Architecture Curriculum</p>
<p class="basic-text">The pre-architecture curriculum begins with d.ONE, a basic design first year common to all undergraduate majors in the College of Architecture. This common first year introduces students to the fundamentals of design Thinking and design Making. The pre-architecture program is followed by three years of architectural instruction leading to a Bachelor of Science in Design. After receipt of the bachelors degree, students may declare intentions to continue for an additional two years of study, leading to a professional Master of Architecture degree. The professional Master of Architecture degree is accredited by the National Architectural Accreditation Board (NAAB).</p>
<p class="basic-text">The College of Architecture, and all six years of the architecture program, are located at UNL.</p>
