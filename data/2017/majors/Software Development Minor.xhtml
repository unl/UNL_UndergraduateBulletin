<p class="content-box-h-1">DESCRIPTION</p>
<p class="basic-text">The software development minor prepares students with skill sets to enable them to meet the growing demand for familiarity and competency with software development. The minor is designed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>enable students from a <span class="basic-text-ital">diverse</span> set of majors and backgrounds to participate; and</li>
<li>provide a <span class="basic-text-ital">strong foundation </span>in software development to allow them to apply computing throughout their career.</li>
</ul>
<p class="header-paragraph">The minor consists of five required courses. The minor's objectives are anchored around a set of core outcomes, such that students completing the minor will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply sound software development principles and methodologies to create software systems that solve real-world problems in various disciplines.</li>
<li>Interact, use and manage large data sets and solve data-centric problems, organize, visualize, and communicate digital data effectively; and use creative competencies to generate creative solutions.</li>
<li>Understand the roles of various stake-holders in software development projects including domain experts, project managers, customers, and developers.</li>
<li>Contribute one's expertise to the solution problems by effectively collaborating and communicating with other stake-holders in software development projects.</li>
</ul>
