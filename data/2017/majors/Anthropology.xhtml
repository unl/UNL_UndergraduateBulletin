<p class="basic-text">The Department of Anthropology synthesizes humanistic and scientific perspectives on human biological and cultural diversity as well as the evolutionary trends seen for humankind. Students and faculty bring this integrated perspective to interactions and collaborations with others in a variety of departments and programs in each of the Colleges across the University.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Courses in anthropology acquaint students with the range of human behavior as differentially explored within each of the subdisciplines within Anthropology—archaeology, biological anthropology, and cultural anthropology. Methodological courses outfit students with valuable analytic and research skills in qualitative, quantitative and GIS analysis as well as in content-appropriate analytic protocols, as for the analysis of archaeological and ethnographic materials.</p>
<p class="basic-text">We value the synergy that comes from working between the subdisciplines of Anthropology. This synergy is realized in our integrated approach to Digital Cultural Heritage, which is the application of information technologies to advance research in the broadly construed and highly interdisciplinary area of culture heritage. Our faculty has special expertise in the development, application, and distribution of content and technologies in Digital Cultural Heritage.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Our Department offers a field school in archeology annually and we help students identify internship opportunities in the city of Lincoln, Nebraska, and the United States. Students have interned at the Smithsonian and at museums and national agencies throughout the United States. In Lincoln, students have completed internships with the Asian Community and Cultural Center, the Indian Center, the National Park Service Midwest Archeological Center (one of two major NPS research laboratories) and the People’s City Mission, to name a few.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Recommendations.</span> Because of the broad and interdisciplinary nature of anthropology, we recommend that majors select additional courses outside the department to enhance their appreciation of and improve their skills in related disciplines. The student’s advisor will make specific course recommendations in keeping with individual needs and interests. See also online Career Paths.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Work.</span> The Department of Anthropology offers graduate work leading to the master of arts degree. A description of the program appears in the Graduate Studies Bulletin.</p>
