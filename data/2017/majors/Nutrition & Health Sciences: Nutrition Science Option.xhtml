<p class="content-box-h-1">DESCRIPTION</p>
<p class="basic-text">The Nutrition Science option is designed for students who wish to combine an emphasis in nutrition with a strong science background. This major provides an appropriate vehicle for premedical, predental, nursing, physical therapy, and laboratory technology majors who may be able to obtain a degree in nutrition and simultaneously meet entrance requirements for a professional program. It is also a suitable avenue for students interested in nutrition research and graduate study since it provides an opportunity to emphasize the basic sciences.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">ADMISSION</p>
<p class="basic-text">The admission requirements for pre-professional programs vary and may change from year to year. Admission to professional programs is competitive. Students need to be aware of not only specific course requirements but also entrance exams, admission deadlines, research and volunteer opportunities, and other activities that enhance the application. In order to receive the most timely information on requirements and preparation, students should visit the Explore Center, 127 Love (Library) South, 402-472-3605.</p>

<p class="title-1">ACE Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">All UNL students will be required to complete a minimum of 3 hours of approved course work in each of the 10 designated Achievement Centered Education (ACE) student learning outcome areas. These can be viewed at http://ace.unl.edu. Students will be provided a list of classes they can select from to meet each of the 10 ACE Student Learning Outcomes (SLO). There may be required courses within an education endorsement program that will also satisfy ACE requirements. Therefore, it is highly recommended that students contact their advisor prior to registering for ACE classes in order to insure that each of the class selections are in the best interest of the students’ academic program.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">ADDITIONAL MAJOR/ENDORSEMENT REQUIREMENTS</p>
<p class="title-1">Grade Rules</p>
<p class="title-2">C- and D Grades</p>
<p class="basic-text">Only grades of C or above will count toward graduation requirements for NUTR courses.</p>
<p class="title-2">Grades Earned at UNL, UNO, UNK</p>
<p class="basic-text">Grades of D-, D, D+, C- satisfy requirements of the programs in human sciences unless specified otherwise under the Programs and Departments section of the bulletin. Students who receive a grade of D-, D, D+, or C-, however, are encouraged to retake the course, particularly if it is in the major area.</p>
<p class="title-2">Grades Earned Outside UN System</p>
<p class="basic-text">Up to 9 hours of grades below C (C-, D+, D, D-) from other academic institutions can only be applied to general education requirements and elective classes.</p>
<p class="title-2">Pass/No Pass Limits</p>
<p class="basic-text">All courses specified by course and number must be taken for a grade.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The Pass/No Pass (P/N) option is designed for students who want to study elective areas or topics when they may have minimum preparation. If used for this purpose, the option can enrich the student’s academic experience without lowering the student’s grade point average. Free electives may be taken P/N. Students can earn no more than 12 hours of pass credit excluding courses offered on Pass/No Pass only basis. Not all classes can be taken under the Pass/No Pass option. All courses, specified by course and number, must be taken for a grade. Should a student have earned a P in one of the courses prior to starting the option, the P will be reviewed by the appropriate department.</p>
