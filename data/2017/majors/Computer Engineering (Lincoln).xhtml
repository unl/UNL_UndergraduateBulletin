<p class="basic-text">The UNL Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) offers Nebraska's only comprehensive program of higher education, research, and service outreach in computer science and computer engineering.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The CSE Department offers a challenging baccalaureate degree program in computer engineering that prepares graduates for professional practice in commerce, industry, and government, and for post-graduate education to enter careers in research and academia. The BS degree in computer engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The focus of the program is integrated hardware/software system design. Increasingly, diverse systems, products, and processes depend on computers for design, control, data acquisition, and other functions. The computer engineer possesses the range of expertise to have an integrated view of computer-based systems and to make global design decisions.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Consistent with this focus, the computer engineering baccalaureate program develops:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to view computer systems as an integrated continuum of technologies and to engage in integrated system-level design. Studies include mathematical foundations, digital logic and technologies, programming and software design, system components and design, application of theory, experimentation, design tools and techniques, and documentation and maintenance.</li>
<li>The ability to work with professionals in related fields over the spectrum of system design. Studies include natural sciences, electricity/electronics, and programming and software design.</li>
<li>Skills to quickly adapt to new work environments, assimilate new information, and solve new problems. Studies develop skills in the application of theory, experimentation, design tools and techniques, documentation and maintenance, and technical communications.</li>
<li>The background and perspective for post-graduate education. Studies develop skills in the application of theory, experimentation, and life-long learning/professional development.</li>
<li>Abilities to work in conformance with societal needs and expectations. Studies include liberal arts and ethical/social issues.</li>
<li>Insight into the world of practicing professionals, for collaborations, mutual support, and representing the profession to government and society. Studies include teamwork and life-long learning/professional development, plus students are provided multiple opportunities for involvement in organizations such as ACM, UPE, and IEEE.</li>
</ul>
<p class="basic-text">The CSE department also offers a degree of bachelor of science in computer science through the College of Arts and Sciences. All students majoring in the CSE department should see their advisors during their first semester to make sure they understand the differences in the requirements of the two programs. Majors should consult with their advisors each semester for registration advising.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Introductory Courses.</span> Entering students may select from several introductory courses according to their interests and as indicated by the CSE Placement Examination. The Computer Science I courses (CSCE 155A, CSCE 155H, CSCE 155E, CSCE 155N, and CSCE 155T) all provide a foundation in designing and programming computing solutions and prepare students for more advanced CSCE courses, including CSCE 156. These courses are designed to meet different interests. CSCE 155A is designed for students majoring in computer science. CSCE 155H is for honors students. CSCE 155E emphasizes computing for systems engineering, such as control systems, mobile computing, and embedded devices and is designed for students majoring in computer engineering. CSCE 155N focuses on numerical and graphical computation in engineering and science, such as applied physics, working with time-sequence data, and matrix applications. CSCE 155T focuses on data and information processing, such as document or database applications, online commerce, or bioinformatics. CSCE 156 is for students with a background in designing and programming computing solutions, such as is provided by Computer Science I. CSCE 101 is for students seeking a broad introduction to computer science with brief instruction in computer programming.</p>
<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Programs.</span> The CSE Department offers several graduate degree programs: master of science in computer science, master of science in computer science with computer engineering specialization, master of science in computer science with bioinformatics specialization, doctor of philosophy in computer science, doctor of philosophy in engineering with computer engineering specialization, doctor of philosophy in computer science with bioinformatics specialization, and joint doctor of philosophy in computer science and mathematics. See the <span class="basic-text-ital">Graduate Studies Bulletin</span> for details.</p>
<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR DEPARTMENT ADMISSION</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are expected to meet minimum college entrance requirements. After being admitted to the college, students wishing to pursue a degree in computer engineering must go through the Professional Admission process, which is automatically performed for qualifying students at the end of the sophomore year. In order to be considered for Professional Admission to the computer engineering program, students must receive at least a C+ in CSCE 155A, CSCE 155H, CSCE 155E, CSCE 155N, or CSCE 155T; CSCE 156; CSCE 230; CSCE 235; ELEC 215; ELEC 235; MATH 106; MATH 107; MATH 208; PHYS 211; PHYS 212 and a GPA of at least 2.5 (semester and cumulative). If a student's cumulative GPA drops below 2.4, a student may be placed on restricted status, may be removed from the College, and may not be able to graduate.</p>
