<p class="content-box-m-p">ADVISING</p>
<p class="title-1">Academic Advising</p>
<p class="basic-text">The College of Architecture is committed to providing effective advising services to students as an essential component of their educational experience.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students in the pre-architecture, pre-landscape architecture, and pre-interior design programs are assigned to a staff advisor. These advisors are located in the centralized Student Success office in Architecture Hall to afford students easy access to information and to the program directors should this be necessary or desirable.</p>
<p class="basic-text">After admission into their respective professional program, students are assigned a faculty advisor. This person serves as an important resource for questions about the professions, their future careers, and their academic plans and progress. Students are encouraged to regularly consult with their advisor and are responsible for initiating advising contacts and preparing for advising sessions. Students must consult with their advisor prior to registering for classes. Failure to do so may result in removal from classes. Ultimately, students are themselves responsible for fulfilling all the requirements of the curriculum in which they are enrolled. The intellectual mentoring relationship between academic advisor and student is protected by confidentiality and strengthened by listening with understanding to student concerns.</p>
<p class="basic-text">The Student Success office houses student records and the staff is helpful in checking on degree requirements and University procedures and policies. The Student Success office also provides information for prospective and entering students who are seeking admission to the College of Architecture.</p>
<p class="content-box-m-p">ACADEMIC PROGRAMS &amp; POLICIES</p>
<p class="title-1">Academic Load</p>

<p class="title-3">Graduation Requirements</p>
<p class="basic-text">During the first year, students are expected to develop a clear understanding of degree requirements and to plan their course of study with a College advisor. Students requiring clarification of outstanding degree requirements should visit with their advisor promptly.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students should access their Degree Audit via MyRed at least once each term to review degree requirements and progress toward graduation. It is the student’s responsibility to make sure their Degree Audit accurately reflects their current College and program of study.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students who believe their Degree Audit has errors or omissions should visit with their advisor promptly. It is important that you resolve these matters as soon as possible to avoid a delay in graduation.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Each student with MyRED access must submit an online Application for Graduation via MyRED for each degree to be received by:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last Friday in January for May graduation</li>
<li>The last Friday in June for August graduation</li>
<li>The last Friday in September for December graduation</li>
</ul>
<p class="basic-text">Students submitting an electronic Application for Graduation via MyRed will be billed a $25.00 per degree fee on their student account. Those students without MyRED access may apply for graduation in person at the Office of the University Registrar, 107 Canfield Administration Building or by mail. Applications for Graduation submitted in person or by mail must be accompanied by a check or money order in the amount of $25.00 payable to the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Failure to submit a timely Application for Graduation may preclude the awarding of a degree in the intended term.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Your Application for Graduation and required $25.00 fee are good only for the term marked on your application. Neither your application nor your fee, are transferrable to another term. If you submit an Application for Graduation and pay the $25.00 fee for a specified term but do not complete your degree requirements in that term, you will need to reapply to graduate in a future term and incur another $25.00 fee.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Commencement ceremony information will be emailed to all degree applicants approximately one month before graduation. Each student who has applied for graduation must submit an online Commencement Attendance Form via MyRED, which will be available when the informational email is distributed.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Only those students who have applied for graduation, had the application accepted, and fulfilled all degree requirements as of the last day of the academic term may participate in the commencement ceremony for that term. Because the University of Nebraska–Lincoln has a commencement for each term, ceremony participation is allowed only in the term during which the student has properly and timely applied for graduation and fulfilled degree requirements.</p>
<p class="title-2">Professional Graduation Check and Application for Degree (M.Arch)</p>
<p class="basic-text">During the last semester of the M.Arch, professional graduation checks are to be initiated by the student and reviewed by the student’s advisor. The Professional graduation check forms are maintained by the advisor and filed in the students’ advising folders.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Professional students must submit an Application for Graduation plus $25.00 check or cash fee for each degree to be received to the Office of the University Registrar by:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last Friday in January for May graduation</li>

Failure to submit a timely Application for Graduation may preclude the awarding of a degree in the intended term.</p>
<p class="title-1">Substitutions and Waivers</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students wishing to propose a course substitution in their curriculum of study must petition the program's Professional Program Committee (PPC) by completing a substitution form. The substitution form should be filled out in consultation with your academic advisor. All proposals must include a detailed explanation for the substitution. The student’s advisor must review and sign the completed form before it can be submitted to the PPC. It is very important that these procedures be followed for an expeditious response to the proposal. Substitutions must be approved before enrolling in a substitute course.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are advised the PPC meets once a month, and will not consider any substitution proposals without a completed form and explanation signed by their advisor. The process to obtain a course substitution is lengthy and can not be accomplished at the “eleventh hour” to compensate for poor academic planning.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Copies of the substitution form are available in the Student Success office.</p>
<p class="title-1">Internships</p>
<p class="title-2">Architecture Internship</p>
<p class="basic-text">An internship program is available to students who have completed the BSD or its equivalent before or during the professional Master of Architecture program.

<p class="title-2">Achievement-Centered Education (ACE)</p>
<p class="basic-text">The University of Nebraska–Lincoln requires all students receive a broad general education as part of their academic experience. This requirement translates into the obligation of all students to fulfill the requirements of the ACE program. Information about the ACE program may be viewed at ace.unl.edu.</p>
<p class="title-3">English and Communication</p>
<p class="basic-text">It is of vital importance that architects, landscape architects, and interior designers be able to express themselves clearly and concisely. As a matter of routine, architects, interior designers, and landscape architects are called upon to prepare reports, papers, or specifications in which clarity and precision are essential. For this reason, a student is required to do more than meet the English composition course requirement. In daily oral and written work the student must demonstrate an acceptable skill in the use of effective English. The dean may require students who fail to meet acceptable standards to do additional work in English composition or speech communication. Each instructor is expected to bring to the dean’s attention the students who need additional work.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are expected to take ENGL 150 or ENGL 151 and COMM 286.</p>
<p class="basic-text">ENGL 186, ENGL 187 and ENGL 192 may not be used to satisfy the freshman English composition requirement.</p>

<p class="requirement-sec-2">Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (BLA) – 120 hours</p>
<p class="title-1">Grading Appeals</p>
<p class="basic-text">A student wishing to appeal a grade should contact his or her professor for clarification first before an appeal can be filed. If the dispute cannot be resolved with the instructor it is recommended that the student meet with their advisor to get clarification on the appeals process. Appeals are only considered where it can be demonstrated that prejudice or capricious treatment influenced the grade received by the student.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Having exhausted these avenues, a student may then choose to make a formal appeal. The appeal is in the form of a written statement from the student to the program director. The director will then forward the letter to the appropriate faculty committee for review. The deadline for filing a grade appeal (which includes a written statement from the student) is 30 calendar days after the first day of classes of the next regular semester (fall or spring). Appeals filed after the deadline will not be heard.</p>
<p class="title-2">Incomplete Grades</p>
<p class="basic-text">Incompletes for students in the pre-professional program shall be granted only for reasons outlined in the policy statement adopted by the University Senate. See the Office of the University Registrar's website at http://registrar.unl.edu for the complete text.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Incompletes given to students in the professional programs are granted at the discretion of the faculty awarding the grade. The faculty and student together must file an incomplete form in the Student Success office to register the anticipated completion date and the grade that will be registered if the work is not completed by that time.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students will be allowed a maximum of two weeks to remove incompletes from courses that are prerequisites to classes in which they are currently enrolled or they will be administratively dropped from those courses.</p>
<p class="title-2">Scholastic Standing</p>
<p class="basic-text">The following scholastic standards have been established to maintain the level of quality for students enrolled in the architecture program:</p>
<p class="title-3">Pre-Professional Program, Architecture, Landscape Architecture and Interior Design</p>

<p class="basic-text">Students in the M.Arch program are required to maintain a semester grade point average of 3.0 to remain in good academic standing. The program places students who fail to meet this standard on academic probation.</p>
<p class="title-2">Minimum Grades</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students must earn at least a C (2.0) in all courses with an ARCH, DSGN, IDES, or LARC prefix to earn credit toward their degree. Students will be required to retake all core required courses with a grade of C- or below, but will not be required to repeat courses that were taken as electives.</p>
<p class="title-2">Removal of Grades C- or Below</p>
<p class="basic-text">A student receiving a grade of C- or below for an overall course grade may remove that grade by retaking the same course again and receiving a higher grade. The higher grade will be used to compute the student’s cumulative grade point average, but all grades appear on the student’s transcript. The Pass/No Pass option cannot be used to remove these grades from the grade point average. Please be advised that once a course is no longer taught and no longer offered by the department it is not possible to remove a grade of C- or below through substitution or any other means.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Should you perform poorly in many courses during a semester it is possible to bankrupt the entire semester’s grades. This is a drastic action and should be pursued only after a visit with your advisor.</p>
<p class="title-3">Pass/No Pass Limits</p>
<p class="basic-text">None of the required classes in the degree programs are offered Pass/No Pass, but a maximum of 12 Pass/No Pass credit hours of humanities, social sciences, or open electives may be taken from departments outside the College of Architecture. ACE courses specified by the College of Architecture may not be taken Pass/No Pass.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Courses taken outside the architecture, landscape architecture, or interior design programs to fulfill the upper level outside elective requirement at the 800 level or 900 level, with or without a 400-level counterpart, in a minor, collateral, or supporting area of work, can be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis.</p>
<p class="title-1">Transfer Credit Rules</p>
<p class="basic-text">Transfer credit is evaluated at the College level for general coursework and at the Program level for technical, professional, and nonaccredited credits. </p>
<p class="basic-text title-1">College Evaluation of Transfer Credit</p>
<p class="basic-text">First time students transferring to the College of Architecture from a similar accredited professional degree program will be evaluated on the basis of the current undergraduate bulletin in effect at the time the student enrolls in the College of Architecture.</p>
<p class="title-3">Confirmation procedure:</p>
<p class="list">1. It is the student’s responsibility to initiate this task,</p>
<p class="list">2. The student procedure is to seek review of appropriate materials from the Student Success office, and</p>
<p class="list">3. A “portfolio review” will determine confirmation of credit. This review will be done by the appropriate faculty member or committee.</p>
<p class="title-3">Evaluation of General Education Credits</p>
<p class="title-3">Transfer students who have formally applied for admission will have their academic credits evaluated by the Office of the University Registrar and the College of Architecture. The College will evaluate all hours submitted on an admission application but reserves teh right to reject any of these credits.</p>
<p class="title-3">Program Evaluation of Professional Credit</p>
<p class="title-3">All professional credits earned at another university to be applied toward the Master of Architecture degree must be approved by the Professional Program Committee (PPC) in cooperation with the program director. At least 50 percent of the required course work for the professional degree must be completed at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln with the exception of those students who are applying to enter the program with a four year degree from an accredited architecture program. No professional transfer credit will be accepted from a non-accredited architecture program.</p>
<p class="title-3">Process</p>
<p class="basic-text">The program director will select and identify those courses that are applicable to the professional program in architecture, interior design, and landscape architecture programs. The College of Architecture will not accept courses for transfer which are below a 2.0 on a 4-point scale.</p>
<p class="title-3">Evaluation of Technical and Nonaccredited Transfer Credits</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students who desire to transfer credits from technical or nonaccredited colleges must have architecture credits evaluated by the director and/or appropriate program representatives. Non-architecture credits will be evaluated by the appropriate university department.</p>
<p class="title-3">Evaluation of Graphics, Design, and Production Drawing Credit</p>
<p class="basic-text">Transfer credit for graphics, basic and architectural, landscape architecture, and/or interior design work and production drawings will not be granted until the student’s work has been reviewed by the architecture, landscape architecture, or interior design program director. Allowable transfer credit in the design, production drawings, and graphics areas, whether the grades presented are C, B, or A, will be determined from this review and the student placed accordingly.</p>
<p class="title-1">Independent Study</p>
<p class="basic-text">Credit hours earned through independent study (ARCH 398, ARCH 498, ARCH 598 and ARCH 898; LARC 398, LARC 498; and IDES 398, IDES 498, IDES 898) need to be formally arranged with the faculty member supervising the work prior to registration for those credit hours. This is accomplished through completion of the Independent Study Contract available in the Student Success office. It must have the signature of the faculty sponsor and be filed with the Student Success office in order to be valid.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Students are limited to a total of <span class="basic-text-bold">9 credit hours </span>of independent study over the course of their academic career in the professional program.</p>
<p class="title-1">Other College Degree Requirements</p>
<p class="title-2">Off-Campus Programs</p>
<p class="basic-text">The College of Architecture recognizes the need for some students to pursue their pre-architecture, pre-landscape architecture, and pre-interior design studies at other institutions. One semester (15 credit hours) of off-campus study should cause minimal delay in students’ educational timetables if courses can be selected from the following list and are approved by the College of Architecture. Students are encouraged to coordinate their off-campus pre-architecture, pre-landscape architecture, and pre-interior design programs with the College of Architecture.</p>

<p class="content-box-m-p">DEGREES &amp; MAJORS</p>
<p class="title-1">Organization and Degrees</p>
<p class="basic-text">The College of Architecture consists of four academic programs: architecture, interior design, landscape architecture, and community and regional planning. Architecture, interior design, and landscape architecture all have a one year pre-professional program followed by professional degree programs. In architecture, the first year is followed by a three year program in which students get a Bachelor of Science in Design (BSD) degree and then a 2-Year professional Master of Architecture (M.Arch) degree. For the landscape architecture program, the first year is followed by three years in which students receive a professional Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (BLA) degree. Similarly after the first year, the interior design program is three years and culminates in the professional BSD degree. The community and regional planning program is exclusively a graduate degree program and is addressed in the Graduate Bulletin.</p>
<p class="basic-text">Both architecture and interior design have post professional MS research degrees.</p>

<p class="title-2">Nonprofessional Master of Science Degree and PhD Degrees</p>
<p>The Master of Science (MS) degree is a scholarly, research-based curriculum and is not an accredited professional degree. For more information, please see the University of Nebraska–Lincoln Graduate Bulletin.</p>
<p class="title-2">Community and Regional Planning</p>
<p class="basic-text">The community and regional planning program offers the two-year professional Master of Community and Regional Planning degree which is fully accredited by the Planning Accreditation Board (PAB). In addition, a minor in Community and Regional Planning is available to students.</p>
<p class="content-box-m-p">MINORS &amp; AREAS OF SPECIALIZATIONS OFFERED</p>
<p class="title-1">Landscape Architecture Minor</p>
<p class="basic-text">The landscape architecture minor is administered through the College of Architecture’s landscape architecture program.</p>

The minor in product design provides an opportunity to explore design at a smaller, yet related scale. It allows students to develop academic strengths that will prepare them for advanced study and careers in the design of objects that people interact with on a personal level, of a size and function related to human dimensions. This includes furniture and a variety of manufactured objects.</p>
