      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This course will examine the role of civil society in community planning efforts and offer students a comparative approach to planning theories and approaches.  It will also focus on change within communities and the roles of government, planners, and citizens in reacting to or shaping change.  Students will have an opportunity to explore current issues related to planning and dealing with change by examining controversial practices such as covenants and land trusts, as well as by studying various community responses to change.  Students will understand how citizens, firms and governments act to improve their community and region; the structure and implications of power; the relation between social relationships and economic activity, coalition building, concepts of inclusiveness (class, gender, ethnicity, geography), voice and conflict and its management in communities and regions.   The course will cover dimensions of social capital and the context of change.  Students will learn to use this knowledge to promote equitable change at the community and regional level.  They will study the implications of economic and demographic shifts on strategies and tactics for change and explore various resources for supporting these efforts.  Course will be taught by Iowa State and will be offered summer semester.</div>

      <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Course work will address the considerable demand across the region for such a course from individuals working in communities with new immigrant populations. Many areas in the US experience an increasing immigrant population who represent an important economic engine, but may also be a source of concerns about community continuity and change. This course will be available to practitioners who are facing these issues in their communities and want to frame positive community action. Populations are aging in all of the OECD countries, especially in rural areas. Lower fertility and out-migration of young people is off-set in many counties are off-set by new immigrants. While welcomed by the economic interests, they are seen a putting pressure on social services, of questionable legal status, and of being different. The course will take a comparative approach to how different countries and different communities have responded to new immigrants, based on literature from Australia, Europe, Canada, and the U.S., with reference to Japan and New Zealand. Class members will carry out case studies of the inclusion of immigrants in their own community and an action plan for increasing inclusion to contribute to the economic vitality of that place.</div>

The literature on community-based natural resource management will be examined and alternative ways of valuing natural capital will be assessed. Contrasting theories of the role of natural capital in communities and human society will be linked to their implications for community sustainability in terms of economic vitality, social well-being, and ecosystem health.
