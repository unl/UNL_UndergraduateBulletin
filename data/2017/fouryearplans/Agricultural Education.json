This certification will allow an individual to teach Skilled and Technical Sciences in a Nebraska secondary school (grades 7-12). Completion of the 60 credit hour requirement in the Skilled and Technical Sciences 2 + 2 Teaching Option at UNL, along with the completion of an associate of applied science within a post-secondary institution with a 2 + 2 agreement, will allow a student to complete a BS degree in agricultural education from UNL.\r\n\r\nThe program is an agreement between the College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources (CASNR) and community college systems in Nebraska. The 2+2 program requires a student to complete the first two years at a community college and earn an associate of applied science degree before transferring to the University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln (UNL).
