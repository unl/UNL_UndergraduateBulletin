				<p class="basic-text">Economic analysis is useful in many decisions made by individuals, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and governments. In addition to opportunities in teaching, economists are employed in many branches of government and on the staffs of corporations in manufacturing, insurance, banking, brokerage and other financial services. Economists often serve as consultants, either individually or in consulting firms. Today’s economists deal with problems ranging from monetary and fiscal policy, monopoly and competition, environmental improvement, labor relations, regional development, urban reconstruction, economic development and international business and finance. Economics is also a popular major for students planning to enter professional and graduate programs, particularly in law, foreign service, labor relations, or business administration.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The department of economics offers the opportunity for intensive study in 11 specialized economic areas: economic theory, comparative economic and regional development, econometrics, economic education, economic history, industrial organization and regulation, international trade and finance, institutional economics, labor economics, monetary economics, and public finance.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Order of Studies.</span> Students who plan to take only one year of economics are advised to take ECON 211 and ECON 212, or ECON 210 and a 300-level course in economics. These courses would satisfy the 6 hr Essential Studies requirement. Either ECON 211 and ECON 212 or ECON 210 are prerequisite to most of the courses in the department. Students who major in economics will find it advantageous to take ECON 211 and ECON 212 in their sophomore year.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Work.</span> The advanced degrees of master of arts and doctor of philosophy are offered. For details of these programs see the Graduate Studies Bulletin. </p>
				<p class="basic-text">This department participates in the program for International Studies. For a full description of the program, see “International Studies.”</p>
