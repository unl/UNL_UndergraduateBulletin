				<p class="basic-text">The Department of Civil Engineering offers a complete undergraduate program to students on the Lincoln and Omaha campuses of the University of Nebraska. Curriculum requirements are nearly identical on both campuses. The goal is to prepare students for entry into the civil engineering profession immediately after graduation or to pursue graduate-level work.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The general educational objectives of the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln civil engineering undergraduate program are to prepare our graduates to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">successfully obtain employment in their areas of expertise in the public or private sectors;</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">understand the ethical and professional demands of contemporary civil engineering practice;</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">successfully enroll in graduate engineering or other professional programs;</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">understand the necessity of teamwork in engineering practice;</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">be able to communicate effectively in professional settings;</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">understand and be able to account for the effects of their professional decisions on the quality of life and the environment;</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">successfully pursue professional licensure; and</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">continue to seek further education in a process of life-long learning.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="basic-text">As a professional discipline, civil engineering is closely related to the total human environment. In all professional endeavors, the civil engineer must consider ecological effects as well as the social, economic, and political needs of people. The civil engineer designs systems to control and manage our water resources to provide electric power, agricultural irrigation, flood control, recreation, water supplies and wastewater treatment systems for our urban and industrial needs.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The civil engineer plans, designs, and constructs our transportation systems including highways, railroads, waterways, and airports to connect rural, urban, and industrial areas. The civil engineer also designs and constructs housing and facilities for recreational, industrial, and commercial complexes, which comprise the urban environment. It is the responsibility of civil engineering to minimize air, water, and land pollution and protect the environment.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Instructional emphasis is placed on fundamental engineering principles derived from mathematics, chemistry, physics, and engineering science. These subjects provide a sound background for the subsequent introductory courses in environmental, geotechnical, structural, transportation, and water resources engineering. Students are introduced to design concepts in the freshman year. Design is incorporated throughout the curriculum that culminates in two senior-level courses, CIVE 389 Professional Practice and Management in Civil Engineering and CIVE 489 Senior Design Project.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Instructional laboratories in environmental engineering, hydraulics, geotechnical engineering, structures, and surveying provide each student with an opportunity to learn, through individual participation, the operation of the testing equipment used to establish engineering design criteria and to monitor and model engineering facilities such as water and wastewater treatment plants, river control systems, and structural systems.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Some students may desire to obtain a degree in construction management in addition to the degree in civil engineering. Because some civil engineering courses require prerequisites beyond those required for similar construction management courses, students should obtain the civil engineering degree first. Advising will be done by a civil engineering faculty member familiar with the construction management curriculum. After completing the civil engineering degree, the student will move to the construction management department to complete requirements for the second undergraduate degree in construction management.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The Departments of Civil Engineering and Architecture have a joint program awarding licensing degrees in both fields of study. A bachelors degree in civil engineering and masters degree in architecture are awarded, after approximately seven years of study. The departments work with individual students in tailoring a joint degree program. Several students are currently pursuing joint degrees. More information can be obtained from either department office.</p>
