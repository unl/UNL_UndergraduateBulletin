				<p class="basic-text">Biological systems engineering (BSEN) is one of two engineering degree programs offered through the Department of Biological Systems Engineering. The program allows students to emphasize their engineering course work in one of three areas; biomedical, food and bioproducts, or water and environment. A biological systems engineer could work on systems to micropropagate tissue culture, develop biomaterials and biofibers, design equipment and processes for producing foods and biofuels, or design devices for performing minimally invasive surgery. Still another could be responsible for developing biological sensors and imaging devices for detecting diseases and irregularities in humans, for measuring plant and animal stress, or for controlling the environment of greenhouses and animal facilities. Biological systems engineers could also be involved in resolving environmental issues associated with waste management, water quality and sustainable energy production. Job opportunities for graduates are available in industry, public agencies, consulting, and private practice whereas some head to graduate or professional school.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">After graduation, BSEN alumni will share the attribute of improving the organization for which they work, and the community and country in which they live. They will do this whether they are involved in biomedical engineering, water resources or environmental engineering, food or bioproducts engineering, or other professional endeavors such as business, law or medicine. In doing so, they will:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">provide innovative and effective solutions to problems in a variety of work environments through the use of their unique background in biological systems engineering and the biological sciences;</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">look beyond components in isolation thereby providing holistic solutions to complex issues involving, for example, interactions at the ecosystem, organism, organ, cellular or subcellular level;</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">think logically using appropriate elements of mathematics, science, and engineering to develop, manage and interpret data, to correctly interpret new research findings and, to design new systems for the benefit of society;</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">successfully integrate technical knowledge with communication and interpersonal skills to lead and work effectively in teams, and to articulate the role of engineering decisions in the workplace, community and world;</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">responsibly addressing issues of health and safety, ethics, and environmental impacts of engineering decisions; and</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">continuing their personal growth, professional development and professional and community service through various opportunities provided by institutions, professional societies and other venues.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="basic-text">The Department of Biological Systems Engineering is located in L. W. Chase Hall on East Campus. BSEN students participate in classes and laboratories on both the East and City Campuses. Courses in biomaterials, plant and animal environment, irrigation, soil conservation, food and bioproduct processing, electronics and imaging, and natural resources are offered on the East Campus. Basic courses in math, chemistry, physics, engineering sciences, computers, and electives in mechanical, civil, electrical, industrial, and chemical engineering are taken on the City Campus. Convenient bus transportation is available between campuses.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students benefit from small classes and personal acquaintances with faculty. In consultation with their adviser, students select electives that permit specialization in an emphasis area applicable to their career aspirations. Many students work part-time on departmental research projects, gaining valuable experience for later employment. Students also benefit from summer jobs, internships and co-op programs. These opportunities give students practical experience to learn about careers in engineering. Students also gain valuable experience through participation in professional organizations such as the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers, the Soil and Water Resources Club, the Biomedical Engineering Society, the Nebraska Society of Professional Engineers and the Society for Women Engineers.</p>
