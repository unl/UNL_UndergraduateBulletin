				<p class="basic-text">The UNL Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Department offers Nebraska’s only comprehensive program of higher education, research, and service outreach in computer science and computer engineering.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The CSE Department offers a challenging baccalaureate degree program in computer engineering that prepares graduates for professional practice in commerce, industry, and government, and for post-graduate education to enter careers in research and academia.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The focus of the program is integrated hardware/software system design. Increasingly, diverse systems, products, and processes depend on computers for design, control, data acquisition, and other functions. The computer engineer is the one person with the range of expertise to have an integrated view of computer-based systems and to make global design decisions.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Consistent with this focus, the computer engineering baccalaureate program develops:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">The ability to view the computer systems as an integrated continuum of technologies and to engage in integrated system-level design. Studies include mathematics, logic design, computer organization and architecture, operating systems, systems programming, and systems design</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">The ability to work with professionals in related fields over the spectrum of system design. Studies include computer science, physical sciences, engineering principles, and digital electronics.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Skills to quickly adapt to new work environments, assimilate new information, and solve new problems. Studies include communication, teamwork, problem solving, and broad-based expertise.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">The background and perspective for post-graduate education. Studies develop critical thinking, depth of knowledge, and a foundation for life-long learning.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">An understanding of the social, political, and environmental aspects of professional practice. Studies include ethics, humanities, and social sciences.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Insight into the world of practicing professionals, including the concepts of collaboration, mutual support, and representing the profession to government and society. Practice includes a continual and varied participation in professional organizations such as ACM and IEEE.</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="basic-text">The CSE Department also offers a degree of bachelor of science in computer science through the College of Arts and Sciences. All students majoring in the CSE Department should see their advisers during their first semester to make sure they understand the differences in the requirements of the two programs. Majors should consult with their advisers each semester for registration advising.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">CSCE 155 is the first course for students majoring or minoring in computer science or computer engineering. CSCE 150E is for students majoring in other science or engineering disciplines. CSCE 150A is for students seeking a general introductory course. CSCE 150M is for students interested in multimedia computing. CSCE 156 is for students with experience in object-oriented design and programming. CSCE 101 and CSCE 101L are for students seeking a broad introduction to computing with a brief instruction to computer programming.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Graduate Programs.</span> The CSE Department offers several graduate degree programs: master of science in computer science, master of science in computer science with computer engineering specialization, master of science in computer science with bioinformatics specialization, doctor of philosophy in computer science, doctor of philosophy in computer engineering with computer engineering specialization, doctor of philosophy in computer science with bioinformatics specialization, joint doctor of philosophy in computer science and mathematics. See the Graduate Studies Bulletin for details.</p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1">ADMISSION</p>
				<p class="title-1">Other Admission Requirements</p>
				<p class="title-2">Computer Science Placement Policy</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The required Computer Science and Engineering Placement Exam (CSEPE) is used to assess students’ background in problem solving, computer programming, and relevant mathematics. Students who have not taken a recognized UNL or transfer prerequisite course with a grade of C or better must take the CSEPE.</p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1">MAJOR REQUIREMENTS</p>
				<p class="title-1">Specific Major Requirements</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The computer engineering degree requires 126 hours of course work. There is a set of required core courses in computer science and engineering (36-39 credit hours), electrical engineering (28 credit hours), mathematics (20 credit hours), and physics and chemistry (12 credit hours). Students select technical electives (9 credit hours) from the list below. At least 6 of these 9 credit hours must be from CSCE or RAIK courses. The department maintains a list of CSCE 496 Special Topics selections that may be substituted as technical electives. Students must complete the humanities and social science requirements of the college (12 hours), two technical communication courses, and the college’s freshmen and sophomore seminars.</p>
