				<p class="content-box-h-1">DESCRIPTION </p>
				<p class="basic-text">The business administration major is designed for students who wish to obtain a broad education in business administration rather than specializing in a specific area within the College. Under this option, students may choose courses from any of the departments within the College in any combination. For the student who has an educational goal that bridges two or more areas of business, the general business administration major permits the design of a tailor-made program to fit that goal.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Many organizations seek generalists rather than specialists when hiring employees. Some employers feel that in today’s world of rapid change, individuals who have a broad educational background are more adaptive to this change and are better suited to a variety of roles within the organization.</p>
