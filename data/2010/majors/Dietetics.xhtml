				<p class="content-box-h-1">DESCRIPTION</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The Dietetics (Didactic Program in Dietetics) option is designed for students who wish to become registered dietitians and practitioners in clinical, community, food industry, and foodservice areas of nutrition. Registered dietitians are employed by hospitals, community agencies, and various government or private organizations. The University of Nebraska Didactic Program in Dietetics is currently granted accreditation status by the Commission on Accreditation for Dietetics Education of the American Dietetic Association, 120 South Riverside Plaza, Suite 2000, Chicago, IL 60606-6995, 312/899-0040, ext. 5400. Completion of degree requirements will result in the student being awarded a Verification Statement of Completion of the Didactic Program in Dietetics. Following completion of the Didactic Program in Dietetics, an accredited dietetic internship program is required before students are eligible to take the registration examination and obtain the Registered Dietitian (RD) credential.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Acceptance into an accredited dietetic internship program is competitive. Currently, there is a significant shortage of available internship positions for the number of students applying for acceptance into an internship program. Acceptance into an internship program cannot be guaranteed.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">All required accreditation information can be found at http://cehs.unl.edu/nhs/undergrad/dietetics.shtml.</p>
				<p class="content-box-h-1">ADMISSION</p>
				<p class="title-1">Application to the Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD)</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Following successful completion (a grade of C or above must be earned in all NUTR courses) of prerequisite courses*, application is necessary for entrance into the Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) which consists primarily of nutrition course work at the 300 and 400 level.</p>

				<p class="title-2">Verification Statement of Meeting Didactic Program in Dietetics Requirements</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The Department of Nutrition and Health Sciences will provide a Verification Statement of a student meeting Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) requirements based on the program in effect in the Undergraduate Bulletin the student is using for graduation requirements if the student is continuously enrolled and graduates within five years. If the student cannot finish their studies within this five-year time period, they must comply with the didactic program reflected in the Undergraduate Bulletin currently in effect. The Department of Nutrition and Health Sciences will not accept course work to meet prerequisite courses for DPD program admission or DPD requirements from any university or college outside the University of Nebraska system in which a grade of D-, D, or D+ was earned.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">In order to receive a Verification Statement of a student meeting Didactic Program in Dietetic requirements, a minimum of 15 credits from 300- or 400-level courses must be completed at the University of Nebraskaâ€“Lincoln. Nine of the 15 credit hours must come from three of the following classes: NUTR 450 Medical Nutrition Therapy I, NUTR 452 and NUTR 452L Medical Nutrition Therapy II and Lab, NUTR 455 Advanced Nutrition, or NUTR 473 Organization and Administration of Foodservice.</p>

				<p class="basic-text">Grades of D-, D, D+, C- satisfy requirements of the programs in human sciences unless specified otherwise under the Programs and Departments section of the bulletin. Students who receive a grade of D-, D, D+, or C-, however, are encouraged to retake the course, particularly if it is in the major area.</p>
				<p class="title-2">Grades Earned Outside UN System</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Up to 9 hours of grades below C (C-, D+, D, D-) from other academic institutions can only be applied to general education requirements and elective classes. </p>
				<p class="title-2">Policy for Pass/No Pass Courses</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The Pass/No Pass (P/N) option is designed for students who want to study elective areas or topics when they may have minimum preparation. If used for this purpose, the option can enrich the studentâ€™s academic experience without lowering the studentâ€™s grade point average. Free electives may be taken P/N. Students can earn no more than 12 hours of pass credit excluding courses offered on Pass/No Pass only basis. Not all classes can be taken under the Pass/No Pass option. All courses, specified by course and number, must be taken for a grade. Should a student have earned a P in one of the courses prior to starting the option, the P will be reviewed by the appropriate department.</p>
