				<p class="title-1">College Admission</p>
				<p class="title-2">College Entrance Requirements</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students must have high school credit for (one unit is equal to one high school year):</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">1. 4 units of mathematics: 2 of algebra, 1 of geometry, 1 of precalculus and trigonometry.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">2. 4 units of English.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">3. 3 units of natural science that must include 1 unit of physics and 1 unit of chemistry (chemistry requirement waived for students in construction management).</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">4. 2 units of a single foreign language.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">5. 3 units of social studies.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">6. Students having a composite ACT score of 28 or greater (or equivalent SAT score) will be admitted to the College of Engineering even if they lack any one of the following: trigonometry, chemistry, or physics.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">7. Students having an ACT score of 19 or less in English (or equivalent SAT score) must take ENGL 150 or ENGL 151.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">A total of 16 units is required for admission.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students must have an ACT (enhanced) score of 24 or greater (or equivalent SAT). Students who lack entrance requirements may be admitted based on ACT scores, high school rank and credits, or may be admitted to Pre-Engineering status in the Division of General Studies. Pre-engineering students are advised within the College of Engineering. </p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students who lack entrance units may complete precollege training by Independent Study through the UNL Extended Education, in Summer Sessions courses, or as a part of their first or second semester course loads while in the Division of General Studies or other Colleges at UNL.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students should consult their adviser, their department chair, or the Office of the Dean if they have questions on current policies.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Other Admission Requirements</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Students who transfer from other colleges or universities must meet the freshman entrance requirements and have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.5 for Nebraska residents. Nonresidents must have a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 unless they are transferring from an accredited engineering program, in which case a 2.5 grade point average is acceptable. Students who do not meet this requirement must enroll in another college at the University and achieve a minimum 2.5 cumulative grade point average in the first 12 hours or more of course work taken at UNL. They may then be considered for admission to the College of Engineering.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The College of Engineering accepts courses for transfer for which a C grade or above was received. Grades of D from the University of Nebraska at Kearney, Lincoln, or Omaha may be transferred to fulfill requirements, however, students are strongly encouraged to repeat those courses. All transfer students must adopt the curricular requirements of the undergraduate bulletin current at the time of transfer–not that in use when they entered UNL.</p>

				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="basic-text-bold">1. Pre-Engineering and Pre-Construction Management Students.</span> New students are accepted on a provisional basis to establish their academic credentials and to firm up their career objectives. These students may take freshman- and sophomore-level courses in the College of Engineering. <br /> Readmitted students will be initially classified as pre-engineering, and pre-construction management students when their accumulative GPA for a total of at least 12 credit hours and most recent semester or term GPA at the University of Nebraska is at least 2.5. Students may be reclassified to restricted status if their accumulative GPA falls below 2.4.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="basic-text-bold">2. Regular Engineering Students.</span> Students who have completed 43 credit hours applicable to their engineering degree may apply for formal admission to that degree program. Those exceeding 61 credit hours must receive formal admission to an engineering degree program if they are to continue to take engineering courses taught in the College of Engineering and/or be identified with the College. Transfer students must have at least 12 credit hours of course work from the University of Nebraska on record before an application will be considered.<br /> Students may apply to an engineering degree program during the first four weeks of the fall or spring semester, which must include a complete record of course work. Students may select a first and second choice of a degree program on a single application and may submit no more than two applications and only in successive semesters. Applications are judged on a competitive academic performance basis. The student should contact the department of his/her choice to determine if there are specific requirements. Admission of non-Nebraska residents may be limited to ten percent of the total.<br /> Regular engineering students may be re-classified to a restricted status if their accumulative GPA falls below 2.4. Students may not graduate with a degree in engineering while in the restricted category.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="basic-text-bold">3. Regular Construction Management Students.</span> Pre-construction management students must apply and be admitted to the construction management degree program after completing 30 credit hours of required course work. Students failing to be admitted to the construction management degree program prior to earning 65 credit hours may be dropped as construction management degree candidates.<br /> Regular construction management students who fail to maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.4 may be reclassified as restricted students.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list"><span class="basic-text-bold">4. Restricted Students.</span> These students are ones who are in the Division of General Studies or other colleges, or those who have failed to maintain the academic standards or general policies of the College of Engineering. Restricted students are substantially limited in the choice of courses that may be taken in the College. Restricted students may:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="bullet-1">Retake D and F grades in College of Engineering courses on a space available basis with permission.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Repeat a maximum of three courses in the College any one of which may be taken only twice.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Enroll in CNST 112 and CNST 131.</li>
					<li class="bullet-1">Enroll in ENGM 220 and ENGM 324.</li>

				<p class="numbered-list">2. Students may repeat a maximum of three engineering courses. Students may take any one engineering course a maximum of two times.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">3. At least 30 of the last 36 credit hours needed for a degree must be registered for and completed at UNL or UNO while identified with the College of Engineering. This means that, practically speaking, the last year of a student’s work must be spent in residence. Credit earned during study abroad may be used toward degree requirements if students participate in prior approved programs and register through UNL (see “Study Abroad and Exchange Programs”).</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">4. Pass/No Pass courses: Students in the College of Engineering must take ENGR 10, ENGR 20 and ENGR 400 with the grading option Pass/No Pass. In addition, students may take up to 12 credit hours of courses in the humanities and social sciences on a Pass/No Pass basis. Students in the College of Engineering may not take any other required courses or technical elective courses with the grading option of Pass/No Pass.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">5. Credits for “English for Foreign Students who are Non-native Speakers” at UNL and “English as a Second Language” at UNO are not applicable to degree programs in the College of Engineering.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">6. Six hours of English composition may be substituted for the written communications requirement in all degree programs.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">7. Students who enroll at UNL, UNO, or UNK under the academic year (Fall, Spring, Summer) of this bulletin must fulfill the requirements stated in this UNL bulletin or in any other UNL bulletin which is published while they are enrolled in the College, provided that the bulletin is no more than 10 years old at the time of graduation. A student must, however, meet the graduation requirements from one bulletin only. A student may not choose a portion from one bulletin and the remainder from another bulletin.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Undergraduate Seminars.</span> All freshmen students are required to attend ENGR 10, Freshman Engineering Seminar, a zero credit course. This seminar provides students with a variety of information useful throughout their attendance in the UNL College of Engineering. Sophomore engineering students are required to attend ENGR 20, Sophomore Engineering Seminar, a zero credit course. The Sophomore Engineering Seminar provides information on career planning, interviewing, resumé preparation and coop/internship opportunities.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Design Requirement.</span> All engineering majors require a minimum of 48 credit hours of engineering topics (engineering topics include subjects in the engineering sciences or engineering design). Engineering design is the process of devising a system, component or process to meet desired needs. Engineering design work may be done by individuals; however, team efforts are encouraged where appropriate. Engineering majors are provided an integrated engineering design experience throughout the curriculum. In addition, all engineering programs include a meaningful major design experience that builds upon the fundamental concepts of mathematics, basic sciences, humanities, social sciences, engineering topics, and communication skills.</p>
				<p class="content-box-m-p">BULLETIN TO USE</p>

				<p class="title-1">Minor in International Engineering</p>
				<p class="basic-text">This minor is designed to encourage and give recognition to undergraduate students who enhance their engineering education with courses and experiences consistent with the global nature of engineering and the economy. This minor has four components:</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">1. Twelve (12) credit hours of courses in international engineering and related courses.<br /> The courses must be chosen from the list of courses maintained by the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and the College Office of International Programs. The course list includes all sections of ENGR 490 and MODL 98 and the list of courses included in Appendix 1. In addition,</p>
				<p class="bullet-2">a. A minimum of 3 credit hours must be in ENGR 490 courses.</p>
				<p class="bullet-2">b. A minimum of 6 credit hours must be in 300-level courses or above.</p>
				<p class="bullet-2">c. A maximum of 6 credit hours may be taken Pass/No Pass.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">2. Two (2) semesters with a minimum of 6 credit hours of college-level foreign language.<br /> The actual number of credit hours taken will depend on the specific courses taken by the student.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">3. Participation in a study abroad experience in a program approved by the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and the College Office of International Programs.</p>
				<p class="numbered-list">4. A minimum of 9 credit hours of the course work listed for this minor cannot count toward the undergraduate engineering degree or the master of architectural engineering degree.</p>
				<p class="content-box-m-p">OTHER</p>
				<p class="title-1">Professional Licensure</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The College encourages professional licensure. The majority of the College’s engineering seniors take the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) examination prior to graduation. This examination is administered by the Nebraska Board of Engineers and Architects, a state agency, and the first step in the process of becoming a licensed professional engineer. To become a licensed professional engineer, one must pass the FE exam, have four years of experience, and pass a professional practice examination. Students may take the FE exam in the last semester of their baccalaureate program.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Accreditation</p>
				<p class="basic-text">All programs are accredited by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). The agricultural engineering, biological systems engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering (Lincoln and Omaha campuses), computer engineering (Lincoln and Omaha campus), electrical engineering, electronics engineering, industrial engineering, and mechanical engineering programs are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The master of architectural engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. </p>
				<p class="basic-text">The construction management program is accredited by the American Council for Construction Education.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The undergraduate degree program in construction engineering is accredited. </p>
				<p class="title-1">Scholarships and Financial Aid</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Each year the College awards scholarships to freshmen and upperclassmen worth more than $750,000. Scholarship awards are made possible through generous gifts of alumni and friends, local and national organizations, and through funding by the Nebraska Legislature. Contact the Office of the Dean or the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid for information regarding these awards and for other financial assistance.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">Application for UNL freshmen scholarships automatically makes you eligible for College of Engineering scholarships as well as other university awards such as the Regents and David scholarships. You must submit the UNL Application form (due January 15, prior to the beginning of the next academic year) to be eligible.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">A significant number of entering students have academic records that qualify them for university-wide scholarship awards. Each year about 25 percent of the freshman Regent Scholarship recipients are engineering students.</p>
				<p class="basic-text">A large number of students are able to find part-time employment in fields related to their interests.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Student Organizations in the College</p>
				<p class="title-2">Technical Societies</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The technical student societies help develop a greater personal and professional interest and understanding in engineering, computer science and construction management. Student branches of the major national technical and scientific societies are sponsored by the academic programs and departments.</p>
				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Lincoln Campus.</span> American Institute of Chemical Engineers; The Society for Engineering in Agricultural, Food, and Biological Systems; American Society of Civil Engineers; American Society of Mechanical Engineers; Associated General Contractors; Association for Computer Machinery; Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers; Institute of Industrial Engineers; American Society for Metals; Student Advisory Board; Institute of Transportation Engineers; National Society of Black Engineers; Society of American Military Engineers; Society of Women Engineers; and Society of Automotive Engineers.</p>
				<p class="title-1">Lifelong Learning</p>
				<p class="basic-text">The education of professionals in construction management, engineering, and engineering technology is a continuing process. The groundwork in both technical and nontechnical studies is laid while in college, but education continues after graduation. For a professional, education continues in the technical and in the human and social concerns areas, and may expect to take a leadership role in the community, have a broad awareness of human and social accomplishments, needs, values, and a willingness to take the responsibility for meeting these needs. For these reasons, an integrated program of course work in the humanities and social sciences is a part of the educational requirements.</p>
