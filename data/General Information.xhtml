These five subject areas are English, mathematics, natural sciences, social studies, and foreign language. Successful completion of a minimum of 16 core course requirements, either at the secondary school level or at the college level, is typically used to demonstrate competency. Performance requirements for freshmen include an ACT composite score of 20 or higher, or an SAT combined score of 950 or higher, or a high school class rank in the upper one-half of the graduating class. </p>				<p class="basic-text">Prospective transfer students are also expected to demonstrate competency in the core course requirements, as well as have a cumulative grade point average of at least a C average (2.0 on a 4.0 scale) and at least a C average in the last semester of college enrollment. Several UNL undergraduate colleges require higher grade point averages for transferring into specific academic programs. See the college sections in this bulletin for more specific information about transfer requirements.</p>				<p class="header-paragraph"><span class="header-paragraph-title">Removal of Deficiencies.</span> Because admission requirements establish the level of knowledge and skills which are needed for a student to succeed at UNL, students who are admitted with core course deficiencies are expected to quickly remove them. Although students are encouraged to remove all admission deficiencies prior to enrolling at UNL by taking course work in high school, by correspondence, or in a community college, students who choose to remove their admission deficiencies at UNL will be required to enroll immediately in the specified courses needed to remove their deficiencies and to remain enrolled in such courses each term until their deficiencies are fully removed.</p>				<p class="basic-text">Students must remove admission deficiencies within the following time periods:</p>				<ul>					<li class="bullet-1">4th year math admission deficiency–no later than either 1) the semester in which the student has attempted his or her first 30 credit hours at UNL, or 2) if longer, one calendar year from the time the student first enrolled at UNL.</li>					<li class="bullet-1">any foreign language admission deficiency–no later than either 1) the semester in which the student has attempted his or her first 60 credit hours at any campus in the university system, or 2) if longer, two calendar years from the time the student first enrolls at any campus in the university system.</li>					<li class="bullet-1">all other admission deficiencies–no later than either 1) the semester in which the student has attempted his or her first 30 credit hours at any campus in the university system or 2) if longer, one calendar year from the time the student first enrolled at any campus in the university system.</li>				</ul>				<p class="basic-text">These time periods represent the maximum period for removing admission deficiencies. Shorter periods may apply in individual situations depending upon a variety of factors considered in the admission review process (e.g., the expected graduation date, the program in which the student wishes to enroll, the sequence of courses required to remove the admission deficiency).</p>				<p class="basic-text">Students who fail to successfully compensate for their admission deficiencies within the established time will not be allowed to continue their enrollment at UNL until they have removed all their deficiencies.</p>				<p class="basic-text">College-level course work taken to remove high school core course requirements will not count toward graduation requirements in most of the undergraduate colleges at UNL. It will be used as elective credit only in some of the undergraduate colleges. The College of Business Administration and the College of Architecture will not count these courses towards meeting graduation requirements, not even as elective credit. The College of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources and the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts will consider courses taken to remove deficiencies to satisfy graduation requirements. The College of Education and Human Sciences course work taken to remove high school deficiencies policy is available in the College Academic Advising Center, 105 Henzlik. Additional information about University policies governing the removal of admissions deficiencies is available from the student’s academic adviser.</p>				<p class="title-1">Undergraduate Transfer Credit Policy</p>				<p class="basic-text">This statement outlines important information for students who present undergraduate credit for transfer to a degree program at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. Transfer credit is any post-secondary credit earned at an institution outside the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, including other institutions in the University of Nebraska System (NCTA, UNK, UNO, and UNMC). </p>				<p class="basic-text">The college within the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in which a student enrolls (the degree college) has ultimate responsibility for determining how all credit, including transfer credit, will apply to a specific degree program. Evaluation of transfer credit is based on a review of the comparability of the nature, content and level of the learning experience and its appropriateness to the student’s degree program. The acceptance and use of transfer credit are subject to limitations in accordance with the educational policies of The University of Nebraska–Lincoln. </p>				<p class="title-2">Transfer Credit Practices</p>				<p class="basic-text">The University of Nebraska–Lincoln endorses the Joint Statement on Transfer and Award of Academic Credit approved by the American Council on Education (ACE), the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers (AACRAO), and the Council for Higher Education Accreditation (CHEA). The current issue of Transfer Credit Practices of Designated Educational Institutions, published by AACRAO is an example of a reference used in determining transfer credit.</p>				<p class="basic-text">Applicants must request an official transcript sent to the Office of Admissions from each college attended. Failure to provide transcripts from all colleges or universities attended may result in denial of the application or dismissal from the university. Grades from institutions outside the Universities in the NU System will be used for evaluation and admission, but will not become part of the University cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA). Each degree college determines its policy for acceptance and application of grades below C to degree requirements.</p>				<p class="title-3">A.

For information on specific exams and required scores accepted for credit at UNL see: http://admissions.unl.edu/advanced/#. Credit by Exam (AP, IB, or CLEP credit) may not be transferred directly to University of Nebraska–Lincoln from another institution. However, the scores from these examinations may be sent to University of Nebraska–Lincoln from the testing agency, and credit will be awarded based on UNL’s AP, IB, and CLEP policies.</p>				<p class="basic-text">Students who anticipate applying to professional programs should inquire about the acceptability of Credit by Exam before registering for exams. </p>				<p class="title-3">Credit by Departmental Examination </p>				<p class="basic-text">Credit by departmental examination allows regularly enrolled students to gain academic credit for knowledge they have acquired by self-study or experience. The student’s knowledge base is expected to parallel that of the specific UNL course for which the student wishes to gain credit. A fee of one-half of resident tuition is charged to administer and/or evaluate an examination for credit. Examinations for credit through UNL departments may be taken only by currently enrolled students. A student is not permitted to receive Credit by Examination in a course which is a prerequisite for a course already taken. Credit earned by examination is not applicable for use in an advanced degree program. Credit granted by another college for placement exams or locally designed test-out examinations will not be accepted in transfer. </p>				<p class="title-3">University of Nebraska–Lincoln students who earn credit at another institution</p>				<p class="basic-text">Current UNL students are urged to consult with the appropriate academic adviser before enrolling in any course intended to be applied to the student’s degree.

Undergraduate students are assigned academic advisers through the college or department in which they are majoring. Undergraduate students who have not yet decided upon a college will be referred to an academic adviser in the Division of General Studies.</p>				<p class="title-2">Students Responsibilities in Academic Advising</p>				<p class="basic-text">The University of Nebraska–Lincoln is committed to providing effective academic advising to students as an essential component of their educational experience.</p>				<p class="basic-text">Department and college advisers are assigned to students in their programs for assistance in assessing educational goals, planning programs of study, understanding program requirements, and following policies and procedures. Professional academic advisers in the Division of General Studies provide these services to students who have not yet declared their undergraduate college or major.</p>				<p class="basic-text">Students are ultimately responsible for fulfilling all the requirements of the curriculum in which they are enrolled. Students are also responsible for initiating advising contacts and preparing for advising sessions. The mentoring relationship between academic advisers and students is confidential and is strengthened by advisers listening with understanding to student concerns.</p>				<p class="basic-text">Students are expected to take responsibility for a successful university experience and effective advising session by:</p>				<p class="numbered-list">1. Participating in New Student Enrollment and priority registration programs;</p>				<p class="numbered-list">2. Scheduling appointments with advisers well in advance of priority registration and at other times as needed;</p>				<p class="numbered-list">3.

Acting on recommendations to seek assistance from the various student support services provided by the University.</p>				<p class="title-2">Insert Registration and Records link on main page </p>				<p class="title-2">Maximum Credit Hour Load</p>				<p class="basic-text">Undergraduate students may register for up to 18 credit hours per semester, except for the College of Business Administration which allows a maximum of 19 credit hours and the College of Arts and Sciences and the Hixson-Lied College of Fine and Performing Arts which allow a student to register for up to 20 credit hours. Written permission from the college dean is required to exceed the credit hour per semester maximum and must be filed with an Override Authorization Form at the time of registration.</p>				<p class="title-2">Class Attendance</p>				<p class="basic-text">Students are expected to attend all lectures, recitations, quizzes, and laboratories regularly. The University has no regulation which permits cutting classes.</p>				<p class="basic-text">Students are responsible for the attendance policy set by instructors and should clear absences directly with them.</p>				<p class="basic-text">In cases where a student is unable to contact his or her instructors due to major illness, serious injury, or hospitalization or when given military orders which are effective immediately, a notice may be sent to the student’s instructors by the University Health Center, a family physician, or the Students Affairs Office, 106 Canfield Administration Building, 472-3755. This notice is for the instructor’s information only and does not relieve the student of contacting instructors as soon as possible.</p>				<p class="basic-text">Students involved in University-sponsored activities, including intercollegiate athletics, may need to be excused from a class, lab, or studio meeting. In all instances it is the student’s responsibility to request permission for the absence (preferably in writing) from the instructor and to discuss how the absence will affect their ability to meet the course requirements. Students should do this as soon in the semester as possible. While instructors should seek to the greatest extent possible, consistent with course requirements, to make reasonable accommodation for a student involved in University-sponsored activities, students should recognize that not every course can accommodate absences and neither the absence (nor the notification of an absence) relieves them from meeting the course requirements.</p>				<p class="basic-text">For complete information on class attendance, see the Schedule of Classes.</p>				<p class="title-2">Courses of Instruction</p>				<p class="title-3">Subject Area Abbreviations</p>				<p class="basic-text">The University of Nebraska–Lincoln uses standard abbreviations for academic subject areas and program titles as part of course descriptions.

Equivalent preparation is generally sufficient. If there is doubt about a student’s preparation level, permission to enroll may be requested from the instructor of the course or from the department chairperson. Academic departments reserve the right to deny admission in a course if the prerequisite has not been completed. Academic departments reserve the right to give permission or waive the prerequisite for any course or to substitute for the prerequisite learning obtained by other means than through the prerequisite course(s). See the Courses of Instruction section for each undergraduate college in this bulletin for official listing of course prerequisites.</p>				<p class="basic-text">The use of the words “parallel”, “corequisite”, or “coregister with” in the prerequisite for a course means that both courses are to be taken simultaneously.</p>				<p class="title-2">Grading System</p>				<p class="basic-text">The University uses an A through F grading system.

Special recognition is given to Chancellor’s Scholars, graduating seniors who have maintained a perfect 4.0 grade point in all their collegiate work.</p>				<p class="title-3">The Dean’s List: College Scholars</p>				<p class="basic-text">Each semester, the eight undergraduate colleges identify students who perform at a superior level academically by recording their names on the Dean’s List of the respective colleges. These College Scholars have earned at least a B+ average in a specified number of courses (the standard varies from college to college) during the semester for which they are recognized.</p>				<p class="title-3">Graduation with Distinction in UNL’s Undergraduate Colleges</p>				<p class="basic-text">The colleges also praise their most successful students by recommending them for graduation with distinction, high distinction or highest distinction. While the manner of selection varies from college to college, all graduates with a level of distinction upon graduation have earned the respect of both the university community and the larger society they are about to join. Acknowledgment of such achievement is made publicly at commencement and, of course, is indicated on the student’s diploma.</p>				<p class="header-paragraph">For further information about Nebraska Honors at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln contact:</p>				<p class="list-indent">Dr. Patrice Berger, Director</p>				<p class="list-indent">University Honors Program</p>				<p class="list-indent">University of Nebraska–Lincoln</p>				<p class="list-indent">118 NRC</p>				<p class="list-indent">PO Box 880659</p>				<p class="list-indent">Lincoln, NE 68588-0659</p>				<p class="list-indent">(402) 472-5425</p>				<p class="title-2">Departmental Honors</p>				<p class="basic-text">Many academic departments offer honors courses and provide high-ability students with special research opportunities.

In addition, they should make clear their individual policies regarding the Pass/No Pass grading option and the assignment of I (incomplete) grades. Failure of any faculty member to inform students of special restrictions in these areas could be grounds for a grade appeal case. Grade appeal procedures exist in all UNL undergraduate colleges (see Grade Appeals in individual undergraduate college sections of this bulletin).</p>				<p class="title-3">Pass/No Pass Grading Option</p>				<p class="basic-text">The Pass/No Pass grading option was designed to enable students to take courses in areas of interest where they may feel they have had minimal preparation without adversely affecting their grade point average. Grades of P (pass) are interpreted as a grade of C or better. Neither grade P or N (no pass) contributes to the grade point average.</p>				<p class="basic-text">There are collegiate restrictions on the use of this grading option. Students should see Pass/No Pass in individual undergraduate college sections of this bulletin, see the Schedule of Classes, and talk with their academic advisers concerning the use of this option.</p>				<p class="title-3">Grades of Incomplete</p>				<p class="basic-text">The grade I is used by an instructor at the end of a term to designate incomplete work in a course. It should be used only when students are unable to complete the requirements of the course in the term in which they are registered because of illness, military service, hardship, or death in the immediate family. Incompletes should only be given if the student has already substantially completed the major requirements of the course.</p>				<p class="basic-text">For complete procedures and regulations, see the Schedule of Classes and the Summer Sessions Bulletin.</p>				<p class="title-3">Course Repeat Policy</p>				<p class="basic-text">Only the most recent letter grade received in a given course will be used in computing a student’s cumulative grade point average if the student has completed the course more than once and previously received a grade or grades below C in that course.</p>				<p class="basic-text">The previous grade (or grades) will not be used in computation of the cumulative grade point average, but it will remain a part of the academic record and will appear on any transcript.</p>				<p class="basic-text">A student can remove from his/her cumulative average a course grade of C-, D+, D, D-, or F if the student repeats the equivalent course at the University of Nebraska and receives a grade other than P (pass), I (incomplete), N (no pass), W (withdrew), or NR (no report). If a course is no longer being offered, it is not eligible for the removal process.</p>				<p class="basic-text">For complete procedures and regulations, see the Schedule of Classes and the Summer Sessions Bulletin.</p>				<p class="title-3">Automatic Removal of Grade Factors From Cumulative GPA For Repeated Courses</p>				<p class="basic-text">Courses graded A+ to F for the current semester are checked against all courses taken since the installation of the computerized records system (September, 1986) and grade factors are automatically subtracted for repeated courses originally graded C-, D+, D, D-, or F.</p>				<p class="title-3">Exceptions to Automatic Grade Factor Removal Processing</p>				<p class="basic-text">Independent study courses, special topics courses and variable credit hour courses will not be processed automatically. These courses will be identified to Registration and Records to check the C-, D+, D, D- or F status manually. Any of these courses that qualify for removal will be processed manually by Registration and Records. The student will be notified of the change by a Grade Notification letter.</p>				<p class="title-3">Students must complete an “Undergraduate Course Repeat Re-Computation Request” for the following situations:</p>				<p class="numbered-list">1.

Cross-listed courses (i.e., FINA 365/ECON 365).</p>				<p class="basic-text">Requests for course repeat(s) processing for these exception-type situations are available at, and must be submitted to Registration and Records, 107 Canfield Administration Building, approximately three weeks after the end of the term. Removals processed during this revision period will be reflected in the official (census date) cumulative grade point average. Students not meeting this deadline will be notified of the change approximately two weeks after the request is received. Late changes will not be reflected in the official (census date) cumulative grade point average.</p>				<p class="title-2">Academic Bankruptcy</p>				<p class="basic-text">A student may remove one or two complete semesters of work from their cumulative grade point average and degree consideration by applying to Registration and Records for academic bankruptcy. To qualify, a student must have completed either 15 simultaneous or sequential credit hours with a minimum 3.0 grade point average or 30 hours with a minimum 2.5 grade point average at UNL following the semester(s) the student wishes to remove.</p>				<p class="basic-text">In order to declare a semester bankrupt, all courses taken during the semester are bankrupt (both credit hours and grades). The bankrupt semester is removed from consideration for cumulative grade point average purposes and the bankrupt credit is not used for degree requirements. The semester listing of courses and grades remain evident on the academic record which is used to issue transcripts. A student may not bankrupt a semester after receiving a baccalaureate degree. College Independent Study via Extended Education and Outreach is not included in computing qualifying grade point averages; P grades may not be used to meet bankruptcy requirements.</p>				<p class="basic-text">For complete procedures and regulations, see the Schedule of Classes.</p>				<p class="title-2">Advanced Placement</p>				<p class="basic-text">In order to help students gain credit by advanced standing, the University provides opportunities for advanced placement. UNL participates in the Advanced Placement Program (AP) of the College Entrance Examination Board and the College Level Examination Program (CLEP). Students can obtain detailed information on acceptable courses from the Office of Admissions.</p>				<p class="title-2">Credit by Examination</p>				<p class="basic-text">Some currently-enrolled students, through outside study or relevant experience, may feel prepared to demonstrate that they have attained the knowledge and/or skills required to pass a particular UNL course. As an alternative to enrolling in the course, such students may elect to take a proficiency exam which tests for mastery of the course material. If a student scores satisfactorily on the examination, the student may be awarded credit for the course. Students can obtain detailed information from the dean’s office of their college.</p>				<p class="title-1">Graduation Requirements</p>				<p class="header-paragraph">UNL Policy: Removal of High School Deficiencies (approved by UNL Dean’s Council, August 29, 2006)</p>				<p class="basic-text"><span class="basic-text-bold">UNL students are expected to remove all high school deficiencies within the first 30 hours (foreign language is to be removed within 60 hours) of their course work at UNL.
